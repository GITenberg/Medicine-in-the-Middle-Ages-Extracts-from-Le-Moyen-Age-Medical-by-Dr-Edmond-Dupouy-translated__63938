</div>

<p>In the fourth century of the Christian
era Roman civilization expired; Western
Europe was invaded by the barbarians;
letters and science sought a last refuge at
Alexandria; the Middle Age commenced.</p>

<p>Greek medicine strove to survive the
revolution in the city of the Ptolemies, and
even produced a few celebrated physicians,
<i>i.e.</i>, Alexander Ætius, Alexander Trallian,
and Paulus Ægineta, but at the end of the
seventh century the school of Alexandria
also fell and disappeared in the clouds of a
false philosophy, bequeathing all Hippocratic
traditions to the Arabs, who advanced
as conquerors to the Occident.</p>

<p>The Arabian schools of Dschondisabur,
Bagdad, Damascus, and Cordova were
founded and became flourishing institutions
of learning, thanks to a few Nestorian
Greeks and Jews who were attracted to
these centers of learning; such men as
Aaron, Rhazes, Haly-Abas, Avicenna,
Avenzoar, Averrhoes, Albucasis, and other
writers, who continued the work left by
the Greeks, leaving remarkable books on
medicine and surgery. Unfortunately the
ordinance of Islamism prevented these
scientists from following anatomical work
too closely, and consequently limited the
progress they might otherwise have made
in medicine.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>What occurred in Western Europe
during this period of transition? The
torch of science was extinguished; the
sacred fire on the altar of learning only remained
a flickering emblem whose pale
light was carefully guarded in the chapel
of monasteries. Medicine was abandoned
to the priests, and all practice naturally fell
into an empirical and blind routine. “The
physician-clergy,” says Sprengel, “resorted
in the majority of cases to prayers and
holy water, to the invocations of saints
and martyrs, and inunction with sacred
ointments. These monks were unworthy
of the name of doctor—they were, in fact,
nothing else than fanatical hospital attendants.”</p>

<p>An ephemeral ray of light broke from
the clouds in the <i>renaissance</i> of 805, when
Charlemagne ordered the cathedral schools
to add medicine to their studies as a part
of the <i>quadrivium</i>. Some of the monks
now commenced to study the works of
Celsus and Cœlius Aurelianus, but, ever as
with the Mussulmen, the Catholic religion
forbade the dissection of the human body,
and the monks made no more progress
than the barbarians; so that the masses of
the people had little or no confidence in
clerical medical skill. We find the proof
of a lack of confidence in the Gothic laws
promulgated by Theodoric about this
period—laws kept even into the eleventh
century in the greater portion of Western
Europe. These ordinances, among other
things, proclaim as follows:</p>

<p>“No physician must open a vein of a
woman or a daughter of the nobility without
being assisted by a relative or body-servant;
<i>quia difficillium non est, ut sub tali
occasione ludibrium interdum adhærescat</i>.”
(Their morality was then a subject for
caution.)</p>

<p>“When a physician is called to dress a
wound or treat a disease, he must take the
precaution to settle on his fee, for he cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>2</span>
claim any in case the patient’s life is
endangered.</p>

<p>“He shall be entitled to five sous for
operating on hard cataract.</p>

<p>“If a physician wound a gentleman by
bleeding, he shall be condemned to pay a
fine of one hundred sous; and should the
gentleman die following the operation, the
physician must be delivered into the hands
of the dead man’s relatives, who may deal
with the doctor as they see fit.</p>

<p>“When a physician has a student he
shall be allowed twelve sous for his services
as tutor.”</p>

<p>Towards the tenth century, however,
progress in medicine is at last noticeable.
We see some monks going to make their
studies at Salerno and at Mount Cassin,
where the Benedictine friars had established
a medical college in the previous
century. Constantine had given these
friars Arabian manuscripts, which had been
translated into Latin, with commentaries.
Also the works of the early Greek physicians
and the treatises of Aristotle on
“Natural Science.” It was at Salerno that
Ægidius de Corbeil studied physic before
becoming physician to Philip Augustus.
Nevertheless, medicine remained in darkness
with clerical ignorance, the superstition
and despotism of the church offering
an insurmountable barrier to all science.
Finally a reform was instituted in 1206 by
the foundation of the University of Paris,
which included among its school of learning
a college of medicine, wherein many
students matriculated. The <i>physicus</i> Hugo,
and Obiso, physician to Louis the Great,
were the first professors in the institution.
Degrees were accorded indiscriminately to
the clergy or to the laity, the condition of
celibacy being imposed on the latter likewise.</p>

<p>A medical and surgical service was
organized at the Hotel Dieu, which hospital
was erected before the entrance of
Notre Dame, under the direction of the
clergy. On certain days the priests would
assemble around the holy water font of the
cathedral, <i>supra cupam</i>, in order to discuss
questions in medicine or the connection of
scholastic learning with the healing art.</p>

<p>The University only recognized as
students of medicine persons who held the
degree of master-in-arts. They absolutely
separated the <i>meges</i> and <i>mires</i>, surgeons,
bonesetters, and barbers, who had made
no classical studies, and to whom was
abandoned as unworthy of the real physicians
all that concerned minor surgery.
These officers of health, so-called, of the
Middle Ages were unimportant and little
respected persons; they kept shops and
never went out without carrying one or
two dressing cases; they were only comparable
to drug peddlers; and the University
imposed no vows of celibacy in
their case.</p>

<p>In many literary works in Latin it is
often a question whether to call in a physician
or <i>mire</i>, and certain passages admirably
serve to prove this historical fact.
In the <i>Roman de Dolopatos</i>,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> for example,
the poet tells how to prevent the poisoning
of wounds, as they are easy to cure when
the injury is recent:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">You have heard it told</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To dress a wound while new;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis hard to heal when old.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You’ll find this statement true.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the doctor cometh late</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The wound may poisoned be;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sore may irritate</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And most sad results we see.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In another troubadour song, <i>The
Wicked Surgeon</i> (<i>Vilain Mire</i>), from which
Moliere purloined his play “A Doctor in
Spite of Himself,” we see the wife of the
bone-setter assure every one that her husband
is not only a good surgeon, but likewise
knows as much of medicine and uroscopy
as Hippocrates himself. (We must
not forget that a knowledge of urine was
claimed by <i>mires</i> and <i>meges</i>.) Thus the
bone setter’s wife says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My husband is, as I have said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A surgeon who can raise the dead.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He sees disease in urine hid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Knows more than e’en Ypocras did.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>Roman de la Rose</i> shows us a poor
devil who complains of not being able to
find a surgeon (<i>mire</i>) to dress his wounds,
<i>i.e.</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ne sceus que faire, ne que dire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne pour ma playe trover mire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne par herbe, ne par racine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Je ne peus trover medecine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>3</span></p>
<p>Some years after the founding of the
University of Paris, a great scientific movement
occurred in the Occident. The
Faculty of Montpellier had already acquired
much celebrity. The College of
Surgeons of Paris was established in 1271.
Medical circles counted a brilliant galaxy
of remarkable men, <i>i.e.</i> Richard de Wendmere,
Jean de Saint Amand, Guillaume
Saliceto, the great Albert, Bernard Gordon,
Arnauld de Villeneuve, Lanfranc, and
Roger Bacon. The school of Paris now
wished to direct its own affairs, and accordingly,
in 1280 A.D., separated from
the University and assumed the title <i>Physicorum
Facultas</i>, and its members became
physicians. Sustained by Royal edict, they
obtained rich grants from the church and
from public taxes, but these marks of favor
aroused bitter jealousies; criticism rained
down on the healing art on every hand,
and medicine was lampooned; these physicians
of the thirteenth century were ridiculed
so bitterly as to make the age historical,
and thus inspire the comedy writers
of future generations. This is more than
evidenced in the wicked satires of Guyot
de Provins (<i>Bible Guiot</i>), who cruelly
assails the doctors; it was he who wrote
the poem that said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Young doctors just come from Salern(o)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sell blown-up bladders for lantern.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As we see, from perusing these numerous
lampoons, physicians were not held in
high esteem, notwithstanding the sacerdotal
character in which the profession was invested.
Meantime, in the <i>Roman du Noveau
Renard</i>, we find a passage<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that permits
the supposition that physicians already
possessed a certain amount of medical
erudition; that they were acquainted with
the works of Galen, and had full knowledge
of all writers of the Arabian school,
as well as that of the school of Salerno.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Je faisoie le physicien</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et allegoie Galien,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et montrois oeuvre ancienne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et de Rasis et d’Avicenne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et a tous les faisoie entendre</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In’estoie drois physiciens</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et maistre des practiciens.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In revenge, the author of the “Romance
of Renard” accords but little confidence
to medical art, for he adds very
maliciously:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All belief in medicine is folly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trust it and you lose your life;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For it is a fact most melancholy—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where one is cured two perish in the strife.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Why the poet of the <i>Roman du Renard</i>
was so full of rancor against the doctors of
his time is a problem too difficult to solve;
yet, while he considered them no better
than criminals and dangerous men to society,
he did not fail to call a doctor before
dying. Physicians, for some strange and
unknown reason, have always been criticised
by French literary men in modern as
well as ancient times. Our French authors
have never, as did the masters of Greek
poesy, recognized us as brothers in Apollo.
Permit me here to call their attention to
one of the writers of Greek anthology,
who said of physicians:</p>

<p>“The son of Phœbus himself, Æsculapius,
has instilled into thy mind, O
Praxagorus, the knowledge of that divine
art which makes care to be forgotten. He
has given into thy hands the balm that
cures all evils. Thou, too, hast learned
from the sweet Epion what pains accompany
long fevers, and the remedies to be
applied to divided flesh; if mortals possessed
medicines such as thine, the ferry
of Charon would not be overloaded in
crossing the Styx.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding sarcasm, in spite of
epigrams and calumny, medicine has always
been a source of sublime consolation to the
sick and afflicted, the sufferer—rich and
poor. At all ages the priest has been inclined
to indulge in the practice of physic,
and it was at their instigation that those
nuns known as Sisters of Charity practiced
medicine to a certain extent in the Middle
Ages. In the twelfth century we see the
nuns of the Convent of Paraclet, in Champagne,
following the advice of Abelard,
essaying the surgical treatment of the sick.
It is true the first abbess of this nunnery
was Heloise, in whose history conservative
surgery is not even mentioned. The nuns
who dressed wounds were called <i>medeciennes</i>
or <i>miresses</i>. Gaulthier de Conisi has left a
history of their good works:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And the world wondered when it did learn</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That woman had found a new mission;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the doctors of Montpellier and Salern(o)</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Saw each nun to be a physician.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A fever they knew, a pulse they could feel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And best of it all is, <i>they managed to heal</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>4</span></p>
<p>This tendency of women to care for the
sick now became general. “In our ancient
poets and romancers,” says Roquefort,
“we often notice how young girls<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> were
employed to cure certain wounds, because
they were more tender-hearted and gentle-handed;
as, for example, Gerard de
Nevers, having been wounded, was carried
into a chapel, where “a beautiful maiden
took him in hand to effect a cure, and he
thought so much of her that in brief space
of time he commenced to mend; and was
so much better that he could eat and
drink; and he had such confidence in the
skill of the maiden that, before a month
passed, he was most perfectly cured.”</p>

<p>As early as the sixth century, we note
in the recital, <i>Des Temps Merovingiens</i>, by
Augustin Thierry, that Queen Radegond,
wife of Clotaire I., transformed her royal
mansion into a hospital for indigent women.
“One of the Queen’s pastimes was to go
thither not simply to visit, but to perform
all the most repulsive duties of nurse.”</p>

<p>In Feudal times it was the custom to
educate the girls belonging to the nobility
in practical medicine; also in surgery, especially
that variety of surgery applied to
wounds. This was immensely useful, inasmuch
as their fathers, brothers, husbands
or lovers were gallant “Knights,” who
ofttimes returned from combat or tourney
mutilated or crippled. It was the delicate
hand of titled ladies that rendered similar
service to strange foreign knights who
might be brought wounded to the castle
gates. This is why the knights of old rendered
such devout homage to the gentler
sex—knowing their kindness and love in
time of distress, when bleeding wounds
were to be staunched and fever allayed.
In a Troubadour song, <i>Ancassin et Nicolette</i>,
we find this passage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nicolette, in great alarm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Asked about his pain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Found out of joint his arm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Put it in again;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dressed with herbs the aching bone—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Plants to her had virtues known.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Although the church was hostile to the
philosophy of Aristotle, whose works were
publicly burned in 1209 A.D. by order of
the Council, Pierre de Vernon published,
in the same thirteenth century, a short
poem by the title <i>Les Enseignements d’Aristote</i>,
the object of which was to vulgarize
the scientific portion of the great Greek
author’s Encyclopedia. This treatise commenced
as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Primes saciez ke icest tretiez</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Est le secre de secrez numez,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ke Aristotle le Philosophe y doine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">La fiz Nichomache de Macedoine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sun deciple Alisandre en bone fei,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Le grant, le fiz, a Philippe le Rei,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Le fist en sa graunt vielesce.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Which, translated from old French, reads:
“From whence learn that this treatise is
the secret of secrets, that Aristotle the philosopher,
son of Nichomachus, gave to his
pupil, Alexander the Great, son of King
Philip, and which was composed in his old
age.”</p>

<p>In recalling the fact that Aristotle was
the son of Nichomachus, Pierre de Vernon
probably desired to call the attention of his
readers more to the knowledge of medicine
that the author derived from his father, the
celebrated physician, than to the brilliant
pupil of Plato.</p>

<p>Among the interesting passages in this
poem we distinguish some that advise abstinence
to persons whose maladies are
engendered by excesses at table:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“One man cannot live without wine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While another without it should dine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For the latter, ’tis clear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All grape juice and beer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For his own stomach’s sake should decline.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The author claims drinking at meals
induces gastralgia from acidity of the
stomach:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The signs of bad stomach thus trace:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor digestion, a red bloated face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With out-popping eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Palpitation, and sighs.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With oppression, as though one did lace.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He mentions eructations and sour belching
as indicating frigidity of the stomach,
and advises the drinking of very hot water
before meals. Aside from this, he gives
good counsel relative to all the advantages
of a sober and peaceful life:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If passion within you wax hot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pray don’t eat and drink like a sot.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>5</span>
    <div class="verse indent2">Give wine no license;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From rich food abstinence;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And luxurious peace is your lot.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The author then advises that the mouth
and gums be well taken care of, that the
teeth be neatly cleaned after each meal,
and the entire buccal cavity be rinsed out
with an infusion of bitter-sweet plants or
leaves.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Puis apres si froterez</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vos dents et gencives assez,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Od les escorces tut en tur</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">D’ arbre chaud, sec. amer de savur</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kar iceo les dents ennientit,” etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding their want of scientific
form, these precepts still strongly contrast
with the superstitious practices employed
by the monks in the treatment of disease.
When holy relics failed the priesthood had
resource to supernatural power; they believed
in the faith cure; the touch of a
Royal hand could heal disease. They took
all their scrofulous and goitre patients to
Phillip I. and to Saint Louis. These sovereigns
had not always an excessive faith
in the miraculous gifts they were desired
to bestow, but reasons of State policy
forced them to accept this monkish deceit,
which was regularly practiced by the clergy
every Pentecost Day.</p>

<p>The <i>mise en scene</i> was easily arranged:
the King of France, after holy communion
at Saint Francis Convent, left the building
surrounded by men at arms and Benedictine
friars; then he touched the spots on
his people, saying to each of his afflicted
subjects: “<i>Rex tangit te, Deus sanat te, in
nomine Patris et filii et Spiritus sancti.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Block pretends that the King of England
also enjoyed the power of curing epilepsy,
and remarks <i>apropos</i> to this fact that
the invention is not new, since Pyrrhus,
King of Epirus, possessed the power of
curing individuals attacked by enlarged
spleen by simply pressing his right foot on
that viscera.</p>

<p>But this is no longer a superstition to-day,
since the age of miracles is past and
the divinity of kings a belief almost without
a disciple. However, Gilbert and
Daniel Turner, physicians of the thirteenth
century, give it credence in their writings,
but they are fully entitled to express their
independent opinion.</p>

<p>The priests of the Middle Ages could
not employ themselves as obstetricians,
neither could they treat uterine diseases.
The <i>ventrieres</i> were the only midwives of
the period; these women were allowed to
testify as experts in the courts of justice,
but the burden of proof rested on the testimony
of at least three <i>sage femmes</i> when a
newly-married woman was accused of
pregnancy by a husband, as witness the
following:</p>

<p>“Should a man declare his wife just
wedded be pregnant and she deny the
charge, it is well to conduct the accused
woman to the house of some prudent
female friend, and then that three <i>ventrieres</i>
be summoned who may regard the suspect.
If they declare her to be in a family way,
the provost shall call the midwives as witnesses
as before stated; but if the <i>sage
femmes</i> declare the accused is not pregnant,
then shall the wife have cause against her
husband; but better is it when the husband,
seeing the wrong wrought, shall
humble himself and beg pardon.”</p>

<p>Midwives were sworn, according to
statutes and ordinances, which contained
formulæ reports to be presented to the
judges, to visit girls who complained of
having been raped; fourteen signs of such
deflowerment were admitted in testimony.
Laurent Joubert has transcribed three of
such reports, of which we will reproduce
only one that was addressed to the Governor
of Paris on October 23d, 1672:</p>

<p>“We, Marie Miran, Christophlette
Reine, and Jeannie Porte, licensed midwives
of Paris, certify to whom it may
concern, that on the 22d day of October in
the present year, by order of the Provost
of Paris, of date 15th of aforesaid month,
we visited a house in Rue Pompierre and
there examined a girl aged thirty years,
named Olive Tisserand, who had made
complaint against one Jaques Mudont
Bourgeois, whom she insisted deflowered
her by violence. We examined the plaintiff
by sight and the finger, and found as
follows:</p>

<p>“Her breasts relaxed from below the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>6</span>
neck downwards; <i>mammaæ marcidæ et flaccidæ</i>;
her vulva chafed; <i>os pubis collisum</i>;
the hair on the os pubis curled; <i>pubes in
orbem finuata</i>; the perineum wrinkled;
<i>perinæum corrugatum</i>; the nature of the
woman lost; <i>vulva dissoluta et mercessans</i>;
the lips of private pendant; <i>labia pendenta</i>;
the lesser lips slightly peeled; <i>labiorum oræ
pilis defectæ</i>; the nymphæ depressed; <i>nymphæ
depressæ</i>; the caroncles softened;
<i>carunculæ dissolutæ</i>; the membrane connecting
the caroncles retracted; <i>membrana
connecteus inversa</i>; the clitoris was excoriated;
<i>clitoris excoriata</i>; the uterine neck
turned; <i>collum uteri</i>; the vagina distended;
<i>finus pudoris</i>; in fact, the lady’s hymen is
missing; <i>hymen deductum</i>; finally, the internal
orifice of the womb is open; <i>os
internum matricis</i>. Having viewed this sad
state of affairs, sign by sign, we have found
traces <i>omnibus figillatum perspectis et perforutatis</i>,
etc., and the above-named midwives
certify to the before-mentioned Provost that
the aforesaid statement under oath is true.”</p>

<p>Physicians were not obliged by the
magistrates to determine the nature of
rapes on women; all gynecological questions
were remanded to midwives. In
truth, among all the physicians of antiquity
only Hippocrates discussed uterine complaints
and Ætius studied obstetrics. It
was only in the sixteenth century that midwifery
took its place among the medical
sciences, thanks to Rhodion, Ambroise
Parè, Reif, Rousset, and Guillemeau.
Shortly before this time, that is to say, in
the fifteenth century, Jacques de Foril
published his “Commentaires” on generation,
his ideas being derived from Avicenna;
his notions, however, were absurd,
being wholly based on astrological considerations.
He pretended that an infant
is not viable in the eighth month, because
in the first month the pregnant woman is
protected by Jupiter, from whom comes
life; and in the seventh month by the
moon, which favorizes life by its humidity
and light; while in the eighth month or
reign of Saturn, who eats children, the influence
is hostile. But on the ninth month
the benevolent influence of Jupiter is again
experienced, and for this reason the infant
is more apt to be alive at this period of
gestation.</p>

<p>To the scholastic philosophy of the
Middle Ages we must attribute the prejudice
that, the human body being in direct
connection with the universe, especially
the planets, it was impossible for physical
change to occur without the influence of
the constellations. Thus astrology came
to be considered as an essential part of
medicine. This belief in the influence of
the stars came from the Orient, and was
carried through Europe after the crusades.</p>

<p>As to the treatise on “Diseases of
Women,” attributed to Trotula, a midwife
of the school of Salerno, it is only a formulary
of receipts for the use of women—baths
in the sea-sands under a hot sun to
thin ladies suffering from overfat; signs by
which a good wet-nurse may be recognized:
a method of kneading the head, the
nose, and the limbs of new-born children
before placing them in swaddling clothes;
the use of virgin wine mixed with honey as
a remedy for removing the wrinkles of old
age.</p>

<p>“The <i>Commentaires</i> of Bernard de Provincial
informs us,” says Daremberg, “that
certain practices, not only superstitious but
disgusting, were common among the doctrines
of Salerno; one, for instance, was to
eat themselves, and also oblige their husbands
to eat, the excrement of an ass fried
in a stove in order to prevent sterility;
likewise, to eat the stuffed heart of a diseased
sow in order to forget dead friends,”
etc.</p>

<p>We can form some judgment, from
such observations, as to the <i>therapeutic</i> wisdom
of these doctrines of the school of
Salerno. It is true, however, that at this
epoch but little medicine save that of an
unique and fantastic order was prescribed.
Gilbert, the Englishman, advised, with the
greatest British <i>sang froid</i>, tying a pig to
the bed of a patient attacked by lethargy;
he ordered lion’s flesh in case of apoplexy,
also scorpion’s oil and angle-worm eggs;
to dissolve stone in the bladder, he prescribed
the blood of a young billy-goat
nourished on diuretic herbs.</p>

<p>Peter of Spain, who was archbishop,
and afterwards Pope, under the name of
John XXI., was a man whom historians
claim was more celebrated as a physician
than as Pope; it was this Peter who
adapted the curious medical formulary
known by the title of <i>Circa Instans</i>, and,
had improved on the invention. Those
who wore on their bodies the words “Balthazar,”
“Gaspar” and “Melchior” need
never fear attacks of epilepsy; in order to
produce a flux in the belly, it was only
necessary to put a patient’s excrement in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>7</span>
human bone and throw it into a stream of
water.</p>

<p>Hugo de Lucgnes, in fractures of the
bone, employed a powder composed of ginger
and cannella, which he used in connection
with the “Lord’s Prayer,” in the
meantime also invoking the aid of the
Trinity. He treated hernia by cauterization,
and leprosy by inunctions of mercurial
ointment.</p>

<p>If therapeutics made only slight progress
in the thirteenth century, we cannot
say as much for other branches of the
medical and natural sciences.</p>

<p>Arnauld de Villeneuve, physician, chemist
and astrologer, particularly distinguished
himself by discovering sulphuric, nitric
and hydrochloric acids, and also made the
first essence of turpentine.</p>

<p>Lanfranc attracted large numbers of
students to the College of Saint Come, and
exhibited his skill as an anatomist and
surgeon. In one of his publications he
gives a very remarkable description of
chancres and other venereal symptoms.</p>

<p>At the Faculty of Montpellier, which
was founded in 1220 A.D., we see as the
Dean Roger of Parma, and as professor
Bernard de Gordon, who left a very accurate
account of leprosy and a number of
observations on chancres following impure
connection; these observations are valuable,
inasmuch as they are corroborated by
Lanfranc and his contemporary, Guillaume
de Saliceto, of Italy, <i>two centuries before the
discovery of America</i>.</p>

<p>Albert the Great (Albertus Magnus)
and Roger Bacon also belonged to the
thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Albert de Ballstatt, issue of a noble
family of Swabia, monk of the order of St.
Dominicus, after studying in the principal
schools of Italy and Germany, arrived at
Paris in 1222 A.D., and soon had numerous
auditors, among whom may be mentioned
Saint Augustin, Roger Bacon, Villeneuve,
and other distinguished men. His
lectures attracted such crowds of students
from the University that he was obliged to
speak from a public place in the Latin
Quarter, which, in commemoration of his
success, was called <i>Place Maitre Albert</i>,
afterwards corrupted to Place Maubert.</p>

<p>His writings were encyclopedic, their
principal merit being commentaries on the
works of Aristotle, of whom but little was
known at that period; he studied also the
Latin translations of the Arabian school,
and reviewed Avicenna and Averrhoes,
adding to such works some original observations.</p>

<p>Albert the Great, or Albertus Magnus,
the name posterity has bestowed on this
genius, was also much occupied with
alchemy, and passed for a magician. He
was considered a sorcerer by many, as he
was said to evoke the spirits of the departed,
and produced wonderful phenomena.</p>

<p>Albert’s works on natural history, his
botany and mineralogy are, in reality, taken
from the works of Aristotle, as well as his
<i>parva naturalis</i>, which is only a reproduction
of the <i>Organon</i> of the Greek philosopher;
nevertheless, Albert deserves credit
for his good work in relighting the torch
of science in the Occident.</p>

<p>His disciple, Roger Bacon, was also a
monk; he studied in Paris and afterwards
removed to Oxford, England, where he
actively devoted himself to natural science,
especially physics. He left behind him
remarkable observations on the refraction
of light; explanation of the formation of
rainbows, inventing the magnifying glass
and telescope. His investigations in alchemy
led him to discover a combustible
body similar to phosphorus, while his work
on “Old Age” (<i>De retardtandus senectutis
occidentibus</i>) entitled him to a high position
among the physicians of the thirteenth
century. Although one of the founders of
experimental science, one of the initiators—if
the expression may be used—of scientific
positivism, he also devoted much time
to astrology. Denounced as a magician
and sorcerer by his own <i>confreres</i> in religion,
he was condemned to perpetual
imprisonment, and was only released a few
years before his death, leaving many
writings on almost every branch of science.</p>

<p>It was more than a century after these
two great men died that medical science
commenced its upward flight.</p>

<p>Anatomy, proscribed by the Catholic
Church, had an instant’s toleration in the
middle of the thirteenth century, thanks to
the protection of Frederick II., King of
the Two Sicilies. But an edict of Pope
Boniface VIII., published in 1300, forbid
dissections once more, not only in Italy,
but in all countries under Papal rule.
Nevertheless, in 1316, Mondinus, called
the restorer of anatomy, being professor at
the University of Bologna, had the courage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>8</span>
to dissect the cadavers of two patients in
public; he then published an account of
the same, which Springer declares had
“the advantage of having been made after
nature, and which is preferable to all
works on anatomy published since Galen’s
time.”</p>

<p>Some years later the prejudice against
human dissection disappeared in France,
and anatomy was allowed to be taught by
the Faculties of Paris and Montpellier.
Henri de Hermondaville, Pierre de Cerlata,
and Nicholas Bertrucci were particularly
distinguished anatomists during the
fourteenth century, and traced the scientific
path followed by Vesalius, Fallopius,
Eustachius, Fabrica de Aguapendente,
Sylvius, Plater, Varola de Torre, Charles
Etienne, Ingrassias, and Arantius in the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>From this time dates the escape of
medicine from ecclesiastical authority.</p>

<p>In 1452, Cardinal d’Estouteville,
charged by the Pope with the reorganization
of the University of Paris, obtained
a revocation of the order obliging celibacy,
claiming it to be “impious and senseless”
in the case of doctors.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the Faculty
of Physicians renounced the hospitality of
the University and installed themselves in
a house on the <i>Rue de la Bucherie</i>, the
same being graciously tendered them by
Jacques Desparts, physician to the King.
This faculty now opened a register of its
acts, which later became the <i>Commentaries
of the Society</i>, and, already confident of a
brilliant future and its own strength, the
college engraved on its escutcheon these
words: “<i>Urbi et Orbi Salus</i>,” and declared
itself the guardian of antique morality;
<i>veteris disciplinæ retinentissima</i>. Soon the
dean of the faculty obtained from royalty
the right to coin medals, the same being
bestowed on physicians who rendered
valuable public services; these bore the
imprint of the college coat of arms, and
Guy Patin went so far as to issue his own
coined effigy in 1632 A.D.</p>

<p>The royal authority still further aided
the medical profession and the faculty in
gathering students: for instance, an order
was issued granting physicians titles of
nobility and coats of arms in cases of great
merit; they were also exempted from taxes
and other contributions to the crown, for,
says Louis XIV., who speaks, “We cannot
withhold such marks of honor to men
of learning and others who by their devotion
to a noble profession and personal
merit are entitled to a rank of high distinction.”
Besides, some of the greatest
names in France were inscribed on the
registers of the faculty; let us cite, for
instance, Prader, Mersenne, Saint Yon,
Montigny, Mauvillain, Sartes, Revelois,
Montrose, Farcy, Jurency, and others.
Can it be astonishing that the Faculty of
Medicine, considering such high favors,
was so deeply attached to the royalty that
gave liberty and reputation to the great
thinkers of the age?</p>

<p>The dean, who before the thirteenth
century only had the title <i>Magister
Scolarum</i>, administered the affairs of the
faculty without control, and was recognized
as the chief hierarch of the corporation;
but he was elected by all the professors,
and often chosen outside the professors
of the Faculty. This high office was
thus duly dignified, and it was only justice.</p>

<p>Above the dean, however, was the first
Physician to the King, who was a high
officer of the crown, having the same rights
and privileges as the nobility, securing on
his appointment the title of Count with
hereditary transmission of same to his
family; he was also a Councillor of State
and wore the costume and decorations of
this order. When he came to the faculty
meetings he was received by the dean and
bachelors, for he was also grand master of
hygiene and legal medicine in the realm;
he named all the salaried medical appointments,
notably those of experts in medical
jurisprudence.</p>

<p>Under Charles VIII., Adam Fumee
and Jean Michel, sitting in Parliament as
Councillors; Jacques Coictier, physician to
Louis XI., was the President of the Tax
Commission; while Fernel, no less celebrated
as a mathematician than as a physician,
was the intimate friend of Henri II.
at the same time that Ambroise Pare was
surgeon to the latter King and his two successors;
F. Miron, too, afterwards became
Embassador to Henri III.</p>

<p>Later we see Vautier, physician to
<i>Marie de Medecis</i>, one of the malcontents
sent to the Bastile for political reasons.
Valot, Daquin and Fagon, all physicians to
Louis XIV., were politicians, but were
also great dispensers of Royal favor. Medical
politicians figured largely in the time
of Louis XIV. Among the independents,
we may cite Guy Patin, the intimate friend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>9</span>
and adviser of Lamoignan and Gabriel
Naude, who was one of the most erudite
men of the age. Under such conditions,
no wonder that medicine entered into a
new phase of progress. The time of study
was now fixed at six years; after this there
were examinations, from which, unfortunately,
however, clinical medicine was
excluded; examinations corresponded with
the grades of Bachelor and doctor; finally—triumphant
act of culmination—came
the thesis with the obligation of the solemn
Hippocratic oath.</p>

<p>The degree of Bachelor had existed
since the foundation of the University of
Paris. The Bacchalauri, or Bachalarrii,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
were always students for the doctoral
title. After numerous other tests, they
signed the following obligation:</p>

<p>1. I swear to faithfully observe all
secrets with honor, to follow the code and
statutes laid down by the Faculty, and to
do all in my power to assist them.</p>

<p>2. I swear to always obey and respect
the Dean of the Faculty.</p>

<p>3. I swear to aid the Faculty in resisting
any undertaking against their honor or
ordinances, especially against those so-called
doctors who practice illicitly; and
also submit to any punishment inflicted for
a proscribed action.</p>

<p>4. I swear to assist in full robes, at all
meetings, when ordered by the Faculty.</p>

<p>5. I swear to assist at the exercises of
the Academy of Medicine and the school
for the space of two years, and sustain any
question assigned me, in medicine or hygiene,
by a thesis. Finally, I swear to be
a good citizen, loving peace and order,
and observe a decent manner in discussion
on all questions laid down by the Faculty.</p>

<p>This oath was read in Latin by the
Dean, and, as enumerated, each candidate
for a degree solemnly answered “I swear”
after each article.</p>

<p>Ranged with physicians at this period,
although on a lower plane, came the surgeons
and barbers; these had been created
under the title of <i>mires</i> and <i>meges</i>, by medical
monks, who could not, under the
canons, resort to surgical operations, as it
is written <i>Ecclesia abhorrhet a sanguine</i>.</p>

<p>Let us continue their history. When
the College of Physicians was added to
the University of Paris, in the twelfth
century, it was specified by the other Faculties
of the institution that surgeons formed
no portion of the medical Faculty, and
were not entitled to any consideration.
These surgeons kept shops and wandered
through the streets with instrument cases
on their backs, seeking clients, and were
assisted in their work by the barbers, who
were even more illiterate than the surgeons;
but, thanks to the exertions of Jean Pitard,
surgeon to Saint Louis, these surgeons
succeeded in forming a corporation in
1271. Their meetings were held in the
dead-house of the Cordeliers’ church, and
they were allowed the same privileges as
the <i>magistri in physica</i>. They were the
surgeons wearing a long robe.</p>

<p>It was only at the end of the century
that Lanfranc obtained from Phillip the
Beautiful an order to reorganize and bestow
degrees for the exercise of surgical
art. The studies were extremely practical;
they required several years’ attendance at
the Hotel Dieu or in the service of some
city surgeon, likewise a certain amount of
literary education. Like the doctors, these
surgeons were permitted to wear a robe
and hat. They were a great success.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the barbers of the fourteenth
century obtained, in their turn, an
edict from Charles V., who recognized
their corporation and authorized the knights
of the razor to practice bleeding, and also
all manner of minor surgery.</p>

<p>The Faculty of Medicine, jealous of the
Surgeons’ College, encouraged the barbers
with all their influence. They founded for
the face scrapers a special course in anatomy
on condition that the barber would
always acknowledge the physician as superior
to the surgeon. The barbers made this
promise, but the time arrived when they
thought themselves stronger than the
Faculty of Medicine; this was in 1593;
but this same year, an order passed by
Parliament, at the instigation of the doctors,
deprived the barbers of all the power
granted them by Charles V.</p>

<p>The barbers thus had their punishment
for defying the Faculty of Medicine.</p>

<p>The College of Surgeons, relieved from
the competition of the barber surgeons,
now claimed the right to become part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>10</span>
the Medical Faculty, and an ordinance of
Francois I. gave them this privilege. Letters
patent were issued that read:</p>

<p>“It is ordained that the before-mentioned,
professors, bachelors, licentiates or
masters, be they married or single, shall
enjoy all the privileges, franchises, liberties,
immunities and exemptions accorded to
the other medical graduates of the University.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this Royal edict and
confirmation of privileges accorded to surgeons
by Henri II., Charles IX., and
Henri III., the Faculty of Medicine positively
refused to open their doors to their
mortal enemies, the much despised barber-surgeons,
as they were termed.</p>

<p>Even Louis XIV. gave up the idea of
making the doctors associate socially with
the surgeons; the latter, then, continued
to keep shops, with a sign of three sacrament
boxes supported by a golden lily, and
were only allowed the cadavers of malefactors
for purposes of dissection; these
bodies were stolen from the Faculty of
Medicine. In the meantime, the regular
barber-surgeons renewed their ancient allegiance
to the doctors, who had vainly
attempted to substitute students in their
places.</p>

<p>To put an end to the struggle, the College
of Surgeons took the desperate but
injurious resolve to admit all barbers to
their institution and recognize their rights
to a surgical degree. A year later, 1660,
the Faculty of Medicine demanded that,
inasmuch as the College of Surgeons admitted
ignorant barbers to their school, the
right of surgeons to wear a medical robe
and hat and bestow degrees be denied.
The Faculty of medicine gained their
suit.</p>

<p>As an indispensable adjunct to the doctor
at this period, let us now mention the
apothecary and the bath-keeper.</p>

<p>The patron of the apothecaries was
Saint Nicholas; they belonged to the corporation
of grocers, where they were represented
by three members. Their central
bureau was at the Cloister Saint Opportune.</p>

<p>The inspection of drug stores and
apothecary shops in Paris occurred once a
year, and was made by three members
elected from the central bureau and two
doctors in medicine. A druggist in Paris
served four years as an apprentice and six
years as an under-dispenser; then the
applicant was obliged to pass two examinations,
and, finally, five extra examinations,
the latter in the presence of the master
apothecaries and two doctors. Notwithstanding
their oath<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to not prescribe medicine
for the sick and not to sell drugs
without a doctor’s written order, druggists
then, as now, had frequent conflicts with
physicians, as the latter are ever jealous of
non professional interference and always
asserting supremacy.</p>

<p>However, it is well to say that druggists
never violated the rule relative to strict
inspection of all drugs before using such
articles. All medicines were passed at the
central bureau before any apothecary
would purchase for dispensing purposes.</p>

<p>As to bath-keepers, they belonged in
antique times, as now, more to the order
of empirics; their history dates far back to
the period when the Romans introduced
their bathing system into Gaul—a system
which was perpetuated up to as late as the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The baths constructed by the ancients
and destroyed by the barbarians, reappeared
again in the Middle Ages, under
the names of vapor baths and furnace
baths. These baths were shops, usually
kept by barbers, where one could be
sheared, sweated or leeched by a tonsorial
artist. All the world then took baths—even
the monks washed themselves sometimes;
in fact, almost every monastery had
its bath-rooms, where the poor could wash
and be bled without pay.</p>

<p>In those days gentlemen bathed before
receiving the order of chivalry. When
one gave a ball it was customary and gallant
to offer all the guests, especially the
ladies, a free bath. When Louis XI. went
out to sup with his loyal subjects, the honest
tradespeople of Paris, he always found
a hot bath at his disposal. Finally, it was
considered a severe penance to forbid a
person from bathing, as was done in the
case of Henry IV., who was excommunicated.</p>

<p>Paris had many bath-houses. From
early dawn until sunset the streets were
filled, with cryers for bath-houses, who invited
all passers-by to enter. In the time
of Charles VI., bath-keepers introduced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>11</span>
vapor baths. Some of these latter were
entirely given up to women; others were
reserved for the King and gentlemen of
the court. The price of vapor baths was
fixed by Police ordinance at twenty centimes
for a vapor bath and forty centimes
for those who washed afterwards. This
price was subject to revision only at the
pleasure of the municipal authorities.</p>

<p>During times of epidemics vapor baths
were discontinued. It was for sanitary
reasons, probably, that an order of the
Mayor of Paris, named Delamere, forbade
all persons taking vapor baths until after
Christmas eve, “on penalty of a heavy
fine.” This same proclamation was repeated
by act of Parliament on December
13th, 1553, “the penalty corporeal punishment
for offending bath-keepers.”</p>

<p>Parisian vapor baths had such wide-spread
reputations and success that an
Italian doctor of the sixteenth century by
the name of Brixanius, who arrived in
Paris, wrote the following verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Balnea si calidis queras sudantia thermis,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In claris intrabis aqua, ubi corpus inungit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Callidus, et multo medicamine spargit aliptes’,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mox ubi membra satis geminis mundata lacertis</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laverit et sparsos crines siccaverit, albo</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Marcida subridens componit corpora lecto.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Already, in the time of Saint Louis, the
number of bath-keepers was so great that
they had a trades union; they were almost
all barbers, too; they washed the body,
cut hair, trimmed corns and nails, shaved
and leeched.</p>

<p>Bath houses more than multiplied from
the twelfth century, imitations of Oriental
customs, due to the crusaders. Baths were
run not only by men, but by old harridans
and fast girls. No respectable woman
ever entered a public bath-house; Christine
de Pisan bears witness to that fact in the
following lines: “As to public baths and
vapor baths, they should be avoided by
honest women except for good cause; they
are expensive and no good comes out of
them, for many obvious reasons; no
woman, if she be wise, would trust her
honor therein, if she desire to keep it.”</p>

<p>The establishments known as vapor
baths, as early as the time of Saint Louis,
had already degenerated into houses of
prostitution. The police, in defense of
public morality, were finally obliged to forbid
fast women and diseased men from
frequenting such places.</p>

<p>In Italy, vapor baths were recognized
officially and tolerated as places of public
debauchery; this was also the case in
Avignon. The Synodal statutes of the
Church of Avignon, in the year 1441, bear
an ordinance drawn by the civil magistrates
and applicable to married men and
also to priests and clergy, forbidding access
to the vapor baths on the Troucat Bridge,
which were set apart as a place of tolerated
debauchery by the municipal authorities.
This ordinance contained a provision that
was very uncommon in the Middle Ages,
<i>i.e.</i>, a fine of ten marks for a violation of
the law during day time and twenty marks
fine for a violation occurring under cover
of night.</p>

<p>In 1448 the city council of Avignon
again tried its hand at regulating the
vapor baths at the bridge; but the golden
days of debauched women had long before
passed away, and the previous century had
witnessed the acme of the courtesans’ fortunes.
The sojourn of the Popes at Avignon
had gathered together from all over
the Globe a motley collection of pilgrims
and begotten a frightful condition of
libertinage; we have the authority of
Petrarch in saying that it even surpassed
that of the Eternal City, and Bishop Guillaume
Durand presented the Council of
Vienna with a graphic picture of this social
evil.</p>

<p>According to the proclamation of
Etienne Boileau, Mayor of Paris in the
reign of Louis IX., barber bath keepers
were forbidden to employ women of bad
reputation in their shops in order to carry
on under cover, as in the massage shops of
the present day, an infamous commerce,
on penalty of losing their outfit—seats,
basins, razors, etc.,—which were to be sold
at public auction for the profit of the public
treasury and the Crown. But we know
full well that the Royal Ordinance of 1254,
which had for its object the reformation of
public debauchery, was only applied for
the space of two years, and that the new
law of 1256 re-established and legalized
public prostitution which offered less objectionable
features than clandestine prostitution.</p>

<p>The use of public baths and hydrotherapy
lasted until the sixteenth century.
At this epoch, and without any known
reason, the public suddenly discontinued
all balneary practices, and this was noticeable
among the aristocratic class as among
the common people. A contrary evil was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>12</span>
developed. “Honest women,” says Vernille,
“took a pride in claiming that they
never permitted themselves certain ablutions.”
Nevertheless, Marie de Romien,
(<i>Instruction pour les Jeunes Dames</i>) in her
classical work for the instruction of young
women, remarks: “They should keep
clean, if it be only for the satisfaction of
their husbands; it is not necessary to do as
some women of my acquaintance, who
have no care to wash until they be foul
under their linen. But to be a beautiful
<i>damoyselle</i> one may wash reasonably often
in water which has been previously boiled
and scented with fragrants, for nothing is
more certain than that beauty flourishes
best in that young woman who not only
looks but smells clean.”</p>

<p>In an opuscle published in 1530, by
one called De Drusæ, we observe that
“notwithstanding the natural laws of propriety,
women use scents more than clean
water; and they thus only increase the bad
smells they endeavor to disguise. Some
use greasy perfumed ointments, others
sponges saturated in fragrants”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Entre leur cuisses et dessoubz les aisselles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pour ne sentir l’espaulle de mouton.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This horror of water did not last long,
however, and at the commencement of the
seventeenth century the false modesty of
women ended with the creation of river
baths, such as exist to-day along the banks
of the Seine.</p>

<p>Was this restoration of cleanly habits
due to medical advice? This question
cannot be answered, but it may not be out
of place to cite that remarkable passage
from the “Essays of Montaigne” on the
hygiene of bathing, which he recommends
in certain maladies:</p>

<p>“It is good to bathe in warm water, it
softens and relaxes in ports where it stagnates
over sands and stones. Such application
of external heat, however, makes
the kidneys leathery and hard and petrifies
the matter within. To those who bathe:
it is best to eat little at night to the end
that the waters drank the next morning
operate more easily, meeting with an
empty stomach. On the other hand, it is
best to eat a little dinner, in order not to
trouble the action of the water, which is
not in perfect accord; nor should the
stomach be filled too suddenly after its
other labor; leave the work of digestion to
the night, which is better than the day,
when the body and mind are in perpetual
movement and activity.</p>

<p>“I have noted, on the occasion of my
voyages, all the famous baths of Christendom,
and for some years past have made
use of waters, for as a general rule I consider
bathing healthy and deem it no risk
to one’s physical condition. The custom
of ablution, so generally observed at times
past in all nations, is now only practiced in
a few as a daily habit. I cannot imagine
why civilized people ever allow their
bodies to become encrusted with dirt and
their pores filled with filth.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>If Montaigne made great use of mineral
waters, he had in revenge a formidable
dread of physicians and their medicines, a
sentiment he inherited from his father,
“who died,” says he, “at the age of
seventy-four years,” and his “grandfather
and great-grandfather died at eighty years
without tasting a drop of physic.”</p>

<p>Montaigne has justly criticized medicine
in several essays on the healing art.
He knew well the <i>intividia medicorum</i>, and
it was for this reason that he remarked that
a physician should always treat a case
without a consultant. “There never was
a doctor,” says Montaigne, “who, on accepting
the services of a consultant, did
not discontinue or readjust something.”
Is not the same criticism deserved at the
present day? How absurd are our medical
consultations. The examples Montaigne
gives of disagreements of doctors
in consultation as to doctrines are equally
applicable to modern times. The differences
of Herophilus, Erasistratus, and the
Æsclepiadæ as to the original causation of
disease were no greater than those of the
schools of Broussais and Pasteur, which
have both acquired a universal celebrity in
less than half a century.</p>

<p>Montaigne insisted that medicine owed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>13</span>
its existence only to mankind’s fear of
death and pain, an impatience at poor
health and a furious and indiscreet thirst
for a speedy cure, but the author of the
“Essays” adds in concluding: “I honor
physicians, not following the feeling of
necessity, but for the love of themselves,
having seen many honest doctors who
were honorable and well worthy of being
loved.”</p>

<p>The reputation for disagreement among
doctors so much insisted on by Montaigne
has served as a well-worn text for many
other critics.</p>

<p>In <i>Les Serres</i> of Guillaume Bouchet, a
contemporary of the author, we find the
same shaft of sarcasm directed at physicians.
Where will you find men in any
other profession save that of medicine who
envy and hate each other so heartily?
What other profession on earth is given
over to such bitter disagreements? How
can common people be expected to honor
and respect experts and savants so-called
when the professors call each other ignoramusses
and asses? Call these doctors
into a case and one after the other they
will disagree as to the diagnosis as well as
to the method of cure. As Pellisson wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When an enemy you wish to kill</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Don’t call assasins full of vice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But call two doctors of great skill</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To give contrary advice.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or in the verses of the original:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“D’un ennemi voulez vous defaire?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ne cherchez pas d’assasins</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Donnez lui deux medecins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Et qui’ils soient d’avis contrarie.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This professional jealousy is always
more apparent than real. Aside from the
rivalry for public patronage physicians are
a very social class of men, as witness their
many festive meetings. We banquet in honor
of St. Luke the physician, and St. Come,
after each thesis, at anniversaries, at the
election of the Dean, and on many other
occasions. It is these co-fraternal meetings
at which are reinagurated the old feelings
of good-fellowship; our little quarrels
only serve to discipline the medical body
and to increase the grandeur of the
Faculty. It is the constant rubbing of
surfaces that makes the true professional
metal glitter.</p>

<p>When we hear new doctors, young
graduates, swear the Hippocratic oath, we
do not forget that the principal articles of
the statute prescribe the cultivation of
friendships, respect for the older members
of the profession, benevolence to the
young beginners, and the preservation of
professional decency and kindness. It
may be insisted that banquets are not to be
considered as medical assemblages, for
there they laugh long and loud, and drink
many a bumper of rich Burgundy; making
joyous discourse; holding to the
famous compliment of Moliere:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Salus, honor et argentum</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Atque bonum appetitum.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We know to-day many of the truthful
precepts of the School of Salerno and their
bearing on the medical records of the
middle ages. Then as now the doctor
had the ever increasing ingratitude of the
patient (<i>ad proccarendam oegrorum ingratitudinem</i>).</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The disciple of Hippocrates meeteth often treatment rude,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The payment of his trouble is base ingratitude.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the patient is in grievous pain the time is opportune</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For a keen, sharp-witted doctor to make a good fortune.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let him profit by the sufferer’s aches and gather in the money,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the ant gets winter provender and the summer bee its honey.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Our ancient friends had no pity for
charlatans, however. They rightfully
abused all medical impostors, as we read
in the precepts of Salerno’s school:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Il n’est par d’ignorant, de chartatan stupide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">D’histron imposteur, ou de Juif fourbe avide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">De sorciere crasseuse ou de barbier bavard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">De faussiare inpudent, ou de moine cafard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">De marchand de savon, ou de avengle oculiste,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">De baigneur imbecile, ou d’absurde alchimiste,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pas d’heretique impur qui ne se targue, enfin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Du beau titre, du nom sacre de medecin.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The investigation of medical science
was far from being an honor to the middle
ages. The best of the profession was
hidden in the doctoral sanctuary, enveloped
in those mysteries which are never penetrated
by the profane and only known to
the initiated.</p>

<p>The recommendations as to the secrets
of our art are addressed to all young
doctors in that famous epilogue commencing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Gardez surtout, gardez qui’un profane vulgaire</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>14</span></p>
<p>Let us invoke God, the Supreme physician,
let us demand the professional banishment
of every doctor who reveals a professional
secret.</p>

</div>


<h3>THE PLAGUE</h3>

<p>Several great epidemics of the Plague
had already devastated the world; the
plague of Athens in the fifth century,
B. C.; the plague of the second
century, in the reign of Marcus Aurelius;
the plague of the third century, in the
reign of Gallus; then came that most terrible
epidemic of the sixth century, known
by the name of the inguinal pestilence,
which, after ravaging Constantinople spread
into Liguria, then into France and Spain.
It was in 542, according to Procopius,
that an epidemic struck the world and consumed
almost all the human species.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>“It attacked the entire earth,” says our
author, “striking every race of people,
sparing neither age nor sex; differences in
habitation, diet, temperament or occupation
of any nature did not stop its ravages;
it prevailed in summer and in winter, in
fact, at every season of the year.</p>

<p>“It commenced at the town of Pelusa in
Egypt, from whence it spread by two
routes, one through Alexandria and the
rest of Egypt, the other through Palestine.
After this it covered the whole world, progressing
always by regular intervals of
time and force. In the springtime of 543
it broke out in Constantinople and announced
itself in the following manner:</p>

<p>“Many victims believed they saw the
spirits of the departed rehabilitated in
human form. It appeared as though these
spirits appeared before the subject about to
be attacked and struck him on certain portions
of the body. These apparitions heralded
the onset of the malady. It is but
fair to say that the commencement of the
disease was not the same in all cases. Some
victims did not see the apparitions, but
only dreamed of them, but all believed
they heard a ghostly voice announcing
their inscription on the list of those who
were going to die. Some claim that the
greater number of victims were not haunted
either sleeping or waking by these ghosts
and the mysterious voice that made sinister
predictions.</p>

<p>“The fever at the onset of the attack
came on suddenly,—some while sleeping,
some while waking, some while at work.
Their bodies exhibited no change of color,
and the temperature was not very high.
Some indications of fever were perceptible,
but no signs of acute inflammation. In
the morning and at night the fever was
slight, and indicated nothing severe either
to the patient or to the physician who
counted the pulse. Most of those who
presented such symptoms showed no indications
of approaching dissolution; but the
first day among some, the second day in
others, and after several days in many
cases, a bubo was observed on the lower
portion of the abdomen, in the groin, or in
the folds of the axilla, and sometimes back
of the ears or on the thighs.</p>

<p>“The principal symptoms of the disease
on its invasion were as I have pointed out;
for the remainder, nothing can be precisely
indicated of the variations of the type of
the disease following temperament; these
other symptoms were only such as were
imprinted by the Supreme Being at his
divine will.</p>

<p>“Some patients were plunged into a condition
of profound drowsiness; others were
victims to furious delirium. Those who
were drowsy remained in a passive state,
seeming to have lost all memory of the
things of ordinary life. If they had any
one to nurse them they took food when
offered from time to time, and if they had
no care soon died of inanition. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>15</span>
delirious patients, deprived of sleep, were
eternally pursued by their hallucinations;
they imagined themselves haunted by men
ready to slay them, and they sought flight
from such fancied foes, uttering dreadful
screams. Persons who were attacked while
nursing the sick were in the most pitiable
condition—not that they were more liable
to contract the disease by contact, however,
for nurses and doctors did not get
the disease from actual contact with the
sufferers, for some who washed and laid
out the dead never contracted the malady,
but enjoyed perfect health throughout the
epidemic; some, however, died suddenly
without apparent cause. Many of the
nurses were overworked keeping patients
from rolling out of bed and preventing the
delirious from jumping from high windows.
Some patients endeavored to throw themselves
in running water, not to quench
their thirst, but because they had lost all
reason. It was necessary to struggle with
many of the sick in order to make them
swallow any nourishment, which they
would not accept without more or less resistance.
The buboes enfeebled certain
patients who were neither drowsy nor delirious,
but who finally succumbed to their
atrocious sufferings.</p>

<p>“As nothing was known of this strange
disease, certain physicians thought its origin
was due to some source of evil hidden
in the buboes, and they accordingly opened
these glandular bodies. The dissection of
the bubo showed sub-adjacent carbuncles,
whose rapid malignity brought on sudden
death or an illness of but few days’ duration.
In some instances the entire body
was covered by black spots the size of a
bean. Such unfortunates rarely lived a
day, and generally expired in an hour.
Many cases died suddenly, vomiting blood.
One thing I can solemnly affirm, that is,
that the wisest physicians gave up all hope
in the case of many patients who afterwards
recovered; on the contrary, many
persons perished at the very time their
health was almost re-established. For all
these causes, the malady passed the confines
of human reasoning, and the outcome
always deceived the most natural predictions.</p>

<p>“As to treatment, the effects were
variable, following the condition of the
victim. I may state that, as a fact, no efficacious
remedies were discovered that
could either prevent the onset of the
disease or shorten its duration. The victims
could not tell why they were attacked, nor
how they were cured.</p>

<p>“Pregnant women attacked inevitably
aborted at death, some succumbing while
miscarrying; some going on to the end of
gestation, dying in labor along with their
infants. Only three cases are known where
women recovered of plague after aborting;
while only one instance is on record where
a newly-born child survived its mother in
this epidemic. Those in whom the buboes
increased most rapidly in size, maturated
and suppurated, most often recovered,
for the reason, no doubt, that the malignant
properties of the bubonic carbuncle
were weakened or destroyed.</p>

<p>“Experience proved that such symptoms
were an almost sure presage of a return to
health. Those, on the contrary, in whom
the tumor did not change its aspect from
the time of its eruption, were attacked with
all the symptoms I have before described.
In some cases the skin dried and seemed
thus to prevent the tumor, although it
might be well developed, from suppurating.
Some were cured at the price of a loss of
power in the tongue, which reduced the
victims to stammer and articulate words in
a confused and unintelligible manner for
the rest of their days.</p>

<p>“The epidemic at Constantinople lasted
four months, three months of which time it
raged with great violence. As the epidemic
progressed the mortality-rate increased
from day to day, until it reached
the point of 5,000 deaths per day, and on
several occasions ran up to as high as
10,000 deaths in the twenty four hours.”</p>

<p>Let us pass over this very important
description that Procopius gives of the
moral effect of this epidemic on the people,
of the scenes of wild and heart-rending
terror, of curious examples of egotism and
sublime devotion, of instances of blind
superstition developed in a great city under
the influence of fear and the dread of a
very problematical contagion.</p>

<p>Evagre, the scholastic, another Greek
historian of the sixth century, recounts in
his works the story of the plague at Constantinople.
He states that he frequently
observed that persons recovering from a
first and second attack subsequently died on
a third attack; also that persons flying
from an infected locality were often taken
sick after many days of an incubating
period, falling ill in their places of refuge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>16</span>
in the midst of populations free, up to that
time, from the pestilence.</p>

<p>In following the progress of this epidemic
from the Orient to the Occident, it
was noticed that it always commenced at
the sea-ports and then traveled inland.
The disease was carried much more easily
by ships than it could be at the present
time, inasmuch as there were no quarantines
and no pest-houses for isolating patients.
It entered France by the Mediterranean
Sea. It was in 549 that the plague
struck Gaul. “During this time,” says
Gregory of Tours, “the malady known as
the <i>inguinal disease</i> ravaged many sections
and the province of Arles was cruelly depopulated.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>This illustrious historian wrote in another
passage: “We learned this year that
the town of Narbonne was devastated by
the <i>groin disease</i>, of so deadly a type that
when one was attacked he generally
succumbed. Felix, the Bishop of Nantes,
was stricken down and appeared to be desperately
ill. The fever having ceased, the
humor broke out on his limbs, which were
covered with pustules. It was after the
application of a plaster covered with cantharides
that his limbs rotted off, and he
ceased to live in the seventieth year of his
age.</p>

<p>“Before the plague reached Auvergne
it had involved most all the rest of
the country. Here the epidemic attacked
the people in 567, and so great
was the mortality that it is utterly impossible
to give even the approximate
number of deaths. Populations perished
<i>en masse</i>. On a single Sunday morning
three hundred bodies were counted in St.
Peter’s chapel at Clermont awaiting funeral
service. Death came suddenly; it struck
the axilla or groin, forming a sore like a
serpent that bit so cruelly that men rendered
up their souls to God on the second
or third day of the attack, many being so
violent as to lose their senses. At this
time Lyons, Bourges, Chalons, and Dijon
were almost depopulated by the pestilence.”</p>

<p>In 590 the towns of Avignon and
Viviers were cruelly ravaged by the
<i>inguinal disease</i>.</p>

<p>The plague reached Marseilles, however,
in 587, being carried there by a
merchant vessel from Spain which entered the
port as a center of an infection. Several
persons who bought goods from this
trading vessel, all of whom lived in one
house nevertheless, were carried off by the
plague to the number of eight. The spark
of the epidemic did not burn very rapidly
at first, but after a certain time the baleful
fire of the pest, after smouldering slowly,
burst out in a blaze that almost consumed
Marseilles.</p>

<p>Bishop Theodorus isolated himself in a
wing of the cloister Saint Victor, with a
small number of persons who remained
with him during the plague, and in the
midst of their general desolation continued
to implore Almighty God for mercy, with
fasting and prayer until the end of the epidemic.
After two months of calm the
population of the city commenced to drift
back, but the plague reappeared anew and
most of those who returned died. The
plague has devastated Marseilles many
times since the epoch just mentioned.</p>

<p>Anglada<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> who, like the writer, derives
most of his citations from Gregory of
Tours, thinks that the plague that devastated
Strasbourg in 591 was only the same
<i>inguinal disease</i> that ravaged Christendom.
He cites, in support of his assertion, that
passage from the historian poet Kleinlande
translated by Dr. Boersch: “In 591 there
was a great mortality throughout our
country, so that men fell down dying in
the streets, expiring suddenly in their
houses, or even at business. When a person
sneezed his soul was apt to fly the
body; hence the expression on sneezing,
‘God bless you!’ And when a person
yawned they made the sign of the cross
before their mouths.”</p>

<p>Such are the documents we possess on
the great epidemic of inguinal plague of
the fourth century, documents furnished
by historians, to whom medical history is
indebted, and not from medical authors,
who left no marks at that period.</p>


<h3>THE BLACK PLAGUE.</h3>

<p>The Black Plague of the fourteenth
century was more destructive even than
the bubonic pest of the sixth century, and
all other epidemics observed up to the
present day. In the space of four years
more than twenty five millions of human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>17</span>
beings perished—one-half the population
of the world. Like all other pestilences,
it came from the Orient—from India, and
perhaps from China. Europe was invaded
from east to west, from south to north. After
Constantinople, all the islands and shores
of the Mediterranean were attacked, and
successively became so many foci of disease
from which the pestilence radiated
inland. Constantinople lost two-thirds of
its population. Cyprus and Cairo counted
15,000 deaths. Florence paid an awful
tribute to the disease, so great being the
mortality that the epidemic has often been
called <i>Peste de Florence</i>; “100,000 persons
perished,” says Boccaccio. Venice lost
20,000 victims, Naples 60,000, Sicily 53,000,
and Genoa 40,000, while in Rome
the dead were innumerable.</p>

<p>In Spain, Germany, England, Poland,
and Russia the malady was as fatal as in
Italy. At London they buried 100,000
persons in the cemeteries. It was the
same in France. Avignon lost 150,000
citizens in seven months, among whom
was the beautiful Laura de Noves, immortalized
by Petrarch, who expired from the
plague in 1348, aged forty-one years.
At Marseilles 56,000 people died in one
month; at Montpellier three quarters of
the population, including all the physicians,
went down in the epidemic. Narbonne
had 30,000 deaths and Strasbourg
16,000 in the first year of the outbreak.
Paris was not spared; the <i>Chronique de
Saint Denis</i> informs us that “in the year
of Grace 1348, commenced the aforesaid
mortality in the Realms of France, the
same lasting about a year and a half, increasing
more and more until Paris lost
each day 800 inhabitants; so that the
number who died there amounted to
more than 500,000 people, while in the
town of Saint Denis the number reached
16,000.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Among the victims were Jeanne de
Bourgogne, wife of Philip VI.; Jeanne II.,
Queen of Navarre, grandchild of Philip the
Beautiful. In Spain, died Alphonse XI.
of Castille. “Happily,” says the <i>Chronicle</i>,
“during the years following the plague
the fecundity of women was prodigious—as
though nature desired to repair the
ravages wrought by death.” The symptoms
and history of this plague have been
described by several ocular witnesses,
among others Guy de Chauliac, the celebrated
surgeon and professor at Montpellier,
who has left the following recital in
quaint old French:</p>

<p>“The disease was such that one never
before saw a like mortality. It appeared
in Avignon in the year of our Saviour 1348,
in the sixth year of the Pontificate of
Clement VI., in whose service I entered,
thanks to his Grace.</p>

<p>“Not to displease you, I shall briefly
narrate for your edification the advent of
the disease.</p>

<p>“It commenced—the aforesaid mortality—in
January and lasted for the space of
seven months.</p>

<p>“The disease was of two kinds. The
first type lasted two months, with a continued
fever and spitting of blood. This
variety killed in three days, however.</p>

<p>“The second type of the disease, prevailing
during the epidemic time, also had
a continued fever, with apostumes and carbuncles
at the external parts, principally
on the axilla and in the groin; all such
attacked usually died in five days.</p>

<p>“The malady was so contagious, especially
that form in which blood-spitting
was noticed, that one not only caught it
from sojourning with the sick, but also,
it sometimes seemed, from looking at
the disease, so that men died without
their servants and were buried without
priests.</p>

<p>“The father visited not his son, nor
the son his father. Charity was dead and
hope disappeared.</p>

<p>“I call the epidemic great, inasmuch
as it conquered all the earth.</p>

<p>“For the pestilence commenced at the
Orient, and cast its fangs against all the
world, passing through Paris towards the
West.</p>

<p>“It was so destructive that it left only
a quarter of the population of mankind behind.</p>

<p>“It was a shame and disgrace to medicine,
as many doctors dared not visit the
sick through fear of becoming infected;
and those who visited the sick made few
cures and fewer fees, for the sick all died
save a few. Not many having buboes escaped
death.</p>

<p>“For preservation, there was no better
remedy than to fly from the infection, to
purge one’s self with aloe pills, to diminish
the blood by phlebotomy, to purify the air
with fire, to comfort the heart with cordials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>18</span>
and apples and other things of good odor;
to console the humors with Armenian bole
and resist dry rot by the use of acid things.
For the cure of the plague we used bleedings
and evacuations, electuaries, syrups
and cordials, and the external apostumes
or swellings were poulticed with boiled
figs and onions mixed with oil and butter;
the buboes were afterwards opened and
treated by the usual cures for ulcers.</p>

<p>“Carbuncles were leeched, scarified
and cauterized.</p>

<p>“I, to avoid infamy, dared not absent
myself from the care of the sick, but lived
in continual fear, preserving myself as long
as possible by the before-mentioned remedies.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, towards the end of the
epidemic, I fell into a fever, which continued
with an aposthume in the groin, and
was ill for nigh on six weeks, being in
such danger that all my companions believed
I should die; nevertheless, the bubo
being poulticed and treated as I have
above indicated, I recovered, thanks be to
the will of God.”</p>

<p>According to the records of that time,
many persons died the first day of their
illness. These bad cases were announced
by a violent fever, with cephalgia, vertigo,
drowsiness, incoherency in ideas, and loss
of memory; the tongue and palate were
black and browned, exhaling an almost
insupportable fetidity. Others were attacked
by violent inflammation of the
lungs, with hemorrhage; also gangrene,
which manifested itself in black spots all
over the body; if, to the contrary, the
body was covered by abscesses, the patients
seemed to have some chance for
recovery.</p>

<p>Medicines were powerless, all remedies
seeming to be useless. The disease attacked
rich and poor indiscriminately; it
overpowered the robust and debilitated;
the young and the old were its victims.
On the first symptom the patients fell into a
profound melancholy and seemed to abandon
all hope of recovery. This moral
prostration aggravated their physical condition,
and mental depression hastened the
time of death. The fear of contagion was
so great that but few persons attended the
sick.</p>

<p>The clergy, encouraged by the Pope,
visited the bedsides of the dying who bequeathed
all their wealth to the Church.
The plague was considered on all sides as
a punishment inflicted by God, and it was
this idea that induced armies of penitents
to assemble on the public streets to do
penance for their sins. Men and women
went half naked along the highways flagellating
each other with whips, and, growing
desperate with the fall of night, they committed
scandalous crimes. In certain
places the Jews were accused of being the
authors of the plague by poisoning the
wells; hence the Hebrews were persecuted,
sometimes burned alive by the fanatical
sects known as Flagellants, Begardes and
Turlupins, who were encouraged in their
acts of violence by the priests, notwithstanding
the intervention of Clement
VI.</p>

<p>Physicians were not only convinced of
the contagious nature of the disease, but
also believed that it could be transmitted
by look and word of mouth. Such doctors
obliged their patients to cover their eyes
and mouth with a piece of cloth whenever
the priest or physician visited the bedside.
“<i>Cum igitur medicus vel sacerdos, vel amicus
aliquem infirmum visitare voluerit, moneat
et introducat aegrum suos claudere et linteamine
operire.</i>”</p>

<p>Guillaume de Machant, poet and <i>valet
de chambre</i> of Philip the Beautiful, mentions
this fact in one of his poems, <i>i. e.</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“They did not dare, in the open air</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To even speak by stealth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest each one’s breath might carry death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By poisoning the other’s health.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And, in the preface of the “Decameron,”
Boccaccio remarks in his turn,
“The plague communicated direct, as fire
to combustible matter. They were often
attacked from simply touching the sick,
indeed it was not even necessary to touch
them. The danger was the same when you
listened to their words or even if they
gazed at you.”</p>

<p>One thing is certain, that is, that those
who nursed the patients surely contracted
the disease.</p>

<p>All the authorities of the Middle Ages
concur in their statements as to the contagious
nature of the plague. The rules
and regulations enforced against the afflicted
were barbarous and inhuman.
“Persons sick and well, of one family,
when the pest developed,” says Black,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>19</span>
“were held, without distinction, in close
confinement in their home, while on the
house door a red cross was traced, bearing
the sad and desperate epitaph, ‘<i>Dieu ayez
pitie de nous!</i>’ No one was permitted to
leave or enter the plague-stricken house
save the physician and nurse, or other persons
who might be authorized by the Government.
The doors of such dwellings
were guarded and kept closed until such a
time as the imprisoned had all died or recovered
their health.”</p>

<p>We can well judge of the terror inspired
by the pestilence by the precautions taken
by the physicians in attendance on the
sick. In his treatise on the plague Mauget
describes the costume worn by those who
approached the bedsides of patients:</p>

<p>“The costumes worn, says he, “were
of Levant morocco, the mask having crystal
eyes and a long nose filled with subtile
perfumes. This nose was in the form of a
snout, with the openings one on each side;
these openings served for respiratory passages
and were well filled at the anterior
portion with drugs, so that at each breath
they contained a medicated air. Under a
cloak the doctor also wore buskins made of
morocco; closely sewed breeches were attached
to the bottines above the ankle;
the shirt, the hat and gloves were also of
soft morocco.”</p>

<p>Thus accoutered the doctor resembled a
modern diver clad in a bathing suit of
leather.</p>

<p>In order not to alarm the population
all public references to funerals were forbidden.
In the ordinances of magistrates
of Paris, passed September 13, 1553, we
read, “And likewise be it declared that the
aforesaid Chamber forbids by statute all
criers of funerals and wines, and all others,
no matter what be their state or condition,
to render for sale at any church, house,
doorway or gate of this city, or on the
streets thereof, any black cloth or mourning
stuffs such as are used for mortuary
purposes, under penalty of forfeiture
of their licenses and property, and confiscation
of all goods, especially of the aforesaid
black cloths.”</p>

<p>Let it be well understood that the great
epidemics of plague in the sixth and twelfth
centuries were of a nature to terrify ignorant
populations. The narratives of the
historians of that epoch show them to be
imbued with the superstitious ideas of antiquity.
This attack of an invisible enemy
whose blows fell right and left paralyzed
and terrified every one. “In the midst of
this orgie of death,” remarks Anglada,
“the thought of self-preservation absorbed
every other sentiment. Dominated by this
selfish instinct the human mind shamelessly
displayed its cowardice, egotism and superstition.
Social ties were rudely sundered,
the affections of the heart laid aside.
The sick were deserted by their relatives;
all flew with horror from the plague-breathing
air and contact with the dreadful
disease. The corpses of the victims of the
epidemic abandoned without sepulture
exhaled a horrible putrid odor, and became
the starting point of new infectious centres.
The worse disorder overthrew all conditions
of existence. Human passion raged
uncontrolled; the voice of authority was
no longer respected; the wheels of civilization
ceased to revolve.”</p>

<p>As to the other epidemics of the plague
that periodically devastated France from
the fourteenth to the eighteenth century we
possess but few historical documents. We
have had in our hands an opuscule by
Pierre Sordes, who was attacked by the
plague in 1587, at the age of twenty, who
afterward wrote a treatise on the epidemic,
which work he dedicated to Cardinal de
Sourdis, the Archbishop of Aquitaine.</p>

<p>The author in this monograph endeavors
to explain the remedies then in
use for preservation against the infection
of the disease. “Avoid all fatigue, anger,
intemperance, too much association with
women, as the act ennervates our forces
and enfeebles our spirits. One should
clothe himself in the wools of Auvergne and
the camulets of Escot.” Moreover, says
our author, “one should perfume his
clothes with laurel, rosemary, serpolet,
marjolane, sage, fennel, sweetbriar, myrrh,
and frankincense.” When the room was
to be disinfected “one should use fumigations
of good dry hay. One should not go
out early without eating and taking a
drink. One should close the ears with a
little cotton scented with musk and hold in
his mouth a clove or piece of angelica root.
One should hold in his hand a piece of
sponge saturated in vinegar, which should
be smelled frequently. One should wear
upon his stomach an acorn filled with
quicksilver and a small pouch containing
arsenic. Finally, one should take twice a
week a pill composed of aloes, myrrh, and
saffron.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>20</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these precautions,
Pierre Sordes was attacked by the plague;
having a buboe in the left groin, which
caused him acute pain and to which he
applied “<i>un emplastre de diachyllum cum
gummis</i>” and afterwards a blister. Not
being able to obtain resolution, feeling his
strength undermined and perceiving his entire
body “covered with black lumps
and spots, fatal prognostic signs to all
who are found thus marked, I called
for a surgeon, the last one left alive,
and he brought his cautery and with it
pierced through the apostume. From then
the fever disappeared little by little, and I
was perfectly cured eight days after the
application of the aforesaid cautery, with
the exception that, reading in a draught
Bartas “Treatise on the Plague,” I brought
on another attack of fever that well nigh
carried me off.</p>

<p>“This is my experience at Figeac in
the year 1587, when the plague destroyed
2500 people, with all the miseries and
calamities that can be read in Greek and
Roman histories.”</p>


<h3>LE MAL DES ARDENTS.</h3>

<p>Towards the end of the tenth century a
new epidemic appeared in Europe, the
ravages of which spread terror among the
people of the Occident; this disease was
known by the name of <i>mal des ardents</i>,
sacred fire, St. Anthony’s fire, St. Marcell’s
fire, and hell fire.</p>

<p>This great epidemic of the Middle Ages
is considered by many modern writers as
one of the forms of ergotism, notwithstanding
the contrary conclusions arrived at by
the Commission of 1776, composed of
such men as Jussieu, Paulet, Saillant, and
Teissier, who were ordered to report as to
the nature of the disease by the Royal
Society. According to the work of this
Commission the <i>mal des ardents</i> was a
variety of plague, with buboes, carbuncles
and petechial spots, while St. Anthony’s
fire was only gangrenous ergotism. This
is a remarkable example of the confusion
into which scientific facts were allowed to
fall through the fault of careless authors.
It is in such instances that we may estimate
the importance of history. We find in the
“Chronicles of Frodoard,” in the year
945, the following: “The year 945, in the
history of Paris and its numerous suburban
villages, a disease called <i>ignis plaga</i> attacked
the limbs of many persons, and
consumed them entirely, so that death
soon finished their sufferings. Some few
survived, thanks be to the intercession of
the Saints; and even a considerable number
were cured in the Church of Notre
Dame de Paris. Some of these, believing
themselves out of danger, left the church;
but the fires of the plague were soon relighted,
and they were only saved by
returning to Notre Dame.”</p>

<p>Sauvel, the translator of Frodoard, remarks
that at this epoch the Church of
Notre Dame served as a hospital for the
sick attacked by the epidemic, and sometimes
contained as high as six hundred
patients.</p>

<p>Another historian of the time was
Raoul Glaber,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> who mentions that “in
993 a murderous malady prevailed among
men. This was a sort of hidden fire, <i>ignis
occultus</i>, the which attacked the limbs and
detached them from the trunk after having
consumed the members. Among some the
devouring effect of this fire took place in a
single night.</p>

<p>“In 1039,” continues our author, “divine
vengeance again descended on the
human race with fearful effect and destroyed
many inhabitants of the world,
striking alike the rich and the poor, the
aristocrat and the peasant. Many persons
lost their limbs and dragged themselves
around as an example to those who came
after them.”</p>

<p>In the <i>Chronicle of France</i>, from the
commencement of the Monarchy up to
1029,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the monk Adhemar speaks of the
epidemic in the following terms: “In these
times a pestilential fire (<i>pestilential ignis</i>)
attacked the population of Limousin; an
infinite number of persons of both sexes
were consumed by an invisible fire.”</p>

<p>Michael Felibien, a Benedictine friar of
Saint Maur, also left notes on the epidemic
of gangrene. He states in his <i>History of
Paris</i>: “In the same year, 1129, Paris, as
the rest of France, was afflicted by the
<i>maladie des ardents</i>. This disease, although
known from the mortality it caused in the
years 945 and 1041, was all the more
terrible inasmuch as it appeared to have
no remedy. The mass of blood, already
corrupted by internal heat which devoured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>21</span>
the entire body, pushed its fluids outwards
into tumors, which degenerated into incurable
ulcers and thus killed off thousands
of people.”</p>

<p>We could make many more citations,
derived from ancient writers, but we think
we have quoted enough authors to prove
that the <i>mal des ardents</i> was only the plague
confounded with the symptoms known as
gangrenous ergotism. Could it not have
been a plague of a gangrenous type? We
cannot positively affirm, however, that it
had no connection with poisoning by the
<i>sphacelia</i> developed in grain, particularly
on rye. Its onset was sudden, and often
very rapidly followed by a fatal termination.
The <i>mal des ardents</i> had no prodroma
with general symptoms and marked
periods, as in gangrenous ergotism, but it
had, to the contrary, an irregular march,
rapid in its evolution, “devouring,” as
Mezeray says, “the feet, the arms, the
face, and private parts, commencing most
generally in the groin.”</p>


<h3>THE ERUPTIVE FEVERS OF THE SIXTH CENTURY —— VARIOLA,
MEASLES, SCARLATINA.</h3>

<p>Before the sixth century, the terrible
period of the plague, one never heard of
the eruptive fevers. Small-pox, measles
and scarlet fever were unknown to the
ancients. Neither Hippocrates nor Galen
nor any of the Greek physicians who practiced
in Rome make mention of these
diseases. The historians and poets of
Greece and Italy who have written largely
on medical subjects remain mute on these
three great questions in pathology. Some
authors have endeavored to torture texts
for the purpose of throwing light on the
contagious exanthemata, but they have not
been repaid for their fresh imagination.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
It is admitted to-day that the eruptive
fevers are comparatively new diseases,
which made their appearance in the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p>The first document that the history of
medicine possesses on this point is that
left by Marius, Bishop of Aventicum, in
Switzerland, who says, in his chronicle,
“<i>Anno 570, morbus validus cum profluvio
ventris et variola, Italiam Galliamque valde
affecit</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Ten years later, Gregory of Tours described
the symptoms of the new disease
in the following terms:<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>“The fifth year of the reign of Childebert,
580, the region of Auvergne was
inundated by a flood and numerous
weather disasters, which were followed by
a terrible epidemic that invaded the whole
of Gaul. Those attacked had violent
fevers, accompanied by vomiting, great
pain in the neighborhood of the kidneys,
and a heaviness in the head and neck.
Matter rejected by the stomach looked
yellowish and even green, many deeming
this to be some secret poison. The peasants
called the pustules corals.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Sometimes,
after the application of cups to the
shoulders or limbs, blisters were raised,
which, when broken, gave issue to sanious
matter, which oftentimes saved the patient.
Drinks composed of simples to combat the
effects of the poison were also very efficacious.</p>

<p>“This disease, which commenced in
the month of August, attacked all the very
young children and carried them off.</p>

<p>“In those days Chilperic was also
seriously afflicted, and as the King commenced
to convalesce his youngest son
was taken with the malady, and when his
extremity was perceived he was given baptism.
Shortly afterwards he was better,
and his eldest brother, named Chlodobert,
was attacked in his turn. They placed the
Prince in a litter and carried him to Soissons,
in the chapel of Saint Medard; there
he was placed in contact with the good
Saint’s tomb, and made vows to him for
recovery, but, very weak and almost without
breath, he rendered his soul to God
in the middle of night.</p>

<p>“In those days, Austrechilde, wife of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>22</span>
King Gontran, also died of the disease;
while Nantin, Count of Angouleme, also
succumbed to the same malady, his body
becoming so black that it appeared as
though calcined charcoal.”</p>

<p>Gregory of Tours, in another chapter,
narrates:</p>

<p>“The year of the reign of King Childebert,
582, another epidemic broke out;
this was accompanied by blackish spots of
a malignant nature, with pustules and vesicles,
and carried off many victims.</p>

<p>“Touraine was cruelly devastated by
this disease. The patient attacked by fever
soon had the surface of his body covered
by vesicles and small pustules. The vesicles
were white and very hard, presenting
no element of softness, and were accompanied
by great pain; when they had
attained maturity they broke and allowed
the humor within to escape. Their sticking
to the clothing of the body added considerably
to the pain. Medical art was
wholly impotent in the presence of this
malady, at least when God did not come
to the doctor’s aid.</p>

<p>“The wife of Count Eborin, who was
attacked by the disease, was so covered by
vesicles that neither her hand nor the sole
of her foot nor any portion of her body
was exempt; even her eyes remained
closed. Soon after the fever ceased the
fall of the pustules occurred, and the patient
recovered without more inconvenience.”</p>

<p>Small-pox came, then, from the Orient—that
eternal center of all pestilences and
curses. From the seventh century the
Saracen armies spread the malady wherever
they passed—in Syria, Egypt, and Spain;
in their turn, the Crusaders, in returning
from the Holy Land, brought the disease
into France, England, and Germany.
From thence the great epidemics of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries, after
which the small-pox became epidemic,
appearing and disappearing without causation,
but always destroying myriads of
victims. “In 1445,” says Sauvel “from
the month of August to Saint Andres’ day
(November 30), over 6,000 infants died in
Paris from small-pox.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The physicians
knew neither the nature nor the treatment
of the new disease.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The measles was first noted at the same
time as the small-pox, making its first
appearance as an epidemic in the sixth
century.</p>

<p>It is more than probable that the
measles originated in Egypt, and according
to Borsieri, it had such an extension
throughout Western Europe that there
were but few persons who had not suffered
attacks. The history of measles,
however, is less clearly defined than that
of small-pox, although Anglada says that it
figured among the <i>spotted diseases</i>, of which
Gregory of Tours speaks.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> But it was
only in the sixteenth century that Prosper
Martian exactly describes the disease.</p>

<p>Says Martian, “It is a disease of a
special type peculiar to children, who can
no more avoid it than small pox. It commences
with a violent fever, followed,
towards the third day, by an eruption of
small red spots, which become elevated by
degrees, making the skin feel rough to the
touch. The fever lasts until the fifth day,
and when it has ceased the papules commence
to disappear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>23</span></p>

<p>Measles was designated in the middle
ages under the name <i>Morbilli</i>, which signified
a petty plague, the same that <i>Morbus</i>
meant a special plague. It is then fair to
presume that the type of disease was
no more serious than it is at the present
day.</p>

<p>It is probable that the measles of the
sixth century included at the same time
small-pox, measles and scarlet fever, of
which the ancients made no differential
diagnosis. Anglada affirms the co-existence
of all forms of eruptive fevers and
gives the following reasons:</p>

<p>“The contemporaneous appearance of
variola and rubeola represents the first
manifestation of an epidemic constitution,
resulting from a collection of unknown influences
as to their nature, but manifest by
their effects. The earth was from thence
prepared to receive scarlatina, and it soon
came to bear its baleful fruits. We do
meet some mention of scarlet fever in the
writings of the Arabian School, but it is
merely suspected and only vaguely indicated.
But when we remember how difficult
it often is to diagnose at first between
variola and measles, we are not astonished
at the indecision manifested in adding
another exanthematous affection to the
medical incognito. It was only after innumerable
observations and the experience
of several centuries that the third new
disease received its nosological baptism.
There is nothing to prove that it did not
co-operate with earlier epidemics of variola
and rubeola, remaining undistinguished as
to type, however.”</p>

<p>What clearly proves that there was
confusion between the various fevers of
exanthemata is that Ingrassias describes
scarlatina in 1510, under the name of
<i>rosallia</i>, adding, “Some think the measles
and <i>rosallia</i> are the same malady; as for
me, I have determined their differences on
many occasions. <i>Nonnulli sunt qui morbillos
idem cum rossalia esse existimant. Nos
autem soepissime distinctos esse affectus, nostrismet
oculis, non aliorum duntaxat relationi
confidentes inspeximus.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>These facts appear conclusive enough
to admit that measles and scarlet fever are,
like variola, the products of the epidemic
constitution developed during the sixth
century, as contemporaries of the bubonic
plague, all these maladies representing the
medical constitution of the first centuries of
the Middle Age.</p>


<h3>THE SWEATING SICKNESS OF ENGLAND.</h3>

<p>The name of Sweating Sickness was
given to the great epidemic of fever that
appeared in England in the fifteenth century,
and from thence extended over
Continental Europe. This epidemic broke
out in the month of September, 1486, in
the army of Henry VII., encamped in
Wales, and soon reached London, extending
over the British Isles with frightful
rapidity. Its appearance was alarming and
during its duration, which was only a
month, it made a considerable number of
victims. “It was so terrible and so acute
that within the memory of man none had
seen its like.”</p>

<p>This epidemic reappeared in England
in 1513, 1517 and 1551. It was preceded
by very moist weather and violent winds.
The mortality was great, patients often
dying in the space of two hours; in some
instances half the population of a town
being carried off. The epidemic of 1529
can only be called murderous; King
Henry VIII. was attacked and narrowly
escaped death. Although flying from
village to village the nobility of England
paid an enormous tribute to the King of
Terrors. The Ambassador from France to
London, M. du Bellay, writing on the 21st
of July, 1529, remarks, “The day I visited
the Bishop of Canterbury eighteen of the
household died in a few hours. I was about
the only one left to tell the tale, and am
far from recovered yet.”</p>

<p>This same year the sweating sickness
spread all over Europe. It made terrible
ravages in Holland, Germany and Poland.
At the famous synod of Luther and
Zwingle, held at Marburg, the Reformed
ministers seized by fear of death prayed
for relief from the pestilence. At Augsburg
in three months eighteen thousand people
were attacked and fourteen hundred died.</p>

<p>This epidemic did not extend as far as
Paris, but it developed in the north of
France and Belgium. Mezeray mentions
this fact in the following terms: “A certain
disease appeared this year (1529), commencing
in England. It was of a contagious
nature, and passed over from France
to the Lower Countries, and thus spread
over most of Europe. Those attacked
sweated profusely; it was for this reason<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>24</span>
that the malady was called the <i>English
Sweat</i>. First one had a hard chill, then a
very high fever, which carried the patient
off in twenty-four hours, unless promptly
remedied.”</p>

<p>Fernel, physician to Henry II., who
practiced in Paris, likewise speaks of this
sudorific sickness in one of his works.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
He says: “<i>Febres sudorificae quae insolentes
magno terrore in omnem inferiorem Germaniam,
in Galliam, Belgicam, et in Britanniam
ab anno Christi millesimo quingentesimo
vigesim autumno potissimum pervagatae
sunt</i>.”</p>

<p>It prevailed almost always in summer
and autumn, especially when the weather
was moist and foggy. Contrary to what is
seen in other epidemics, it was observed
that the weak and poor, the old and
infants were not attacked as often as
robust persons and those in affluent circumstances.</p>

<p>The symptoms noted by physicians,
such as Kaye and Bacon, may be classed
into three distinct periods: 1. The period
of chill, characterized by pains and formication
in the limbs an extraordinary prostration
of the physical forces—a tremulous,
shaky period. 2. The period of sweat,
preceded by a burning heat all over the
body and an unquenchable feverish thirst.
The patient was agitated, disquieted by
terror and despair. Many complained of
spasms in the stomach, followed sometimes
by nausea and vomiting, suffocation and
lumbar pains—a constant symptom ever—headache,
with palpitation of the heart and
præcordial anxiety. 3. This period was
announced by a high delirium, sometimes
muttering, sometimes loquacious; a fetid
sweaty odor, irregular pulse, coma, and,
in the last-named condition, death always
occurred.</p>

<p>The duration of the disease was most
frequently but a few hours, rarely exceeding
a day, whether the termination was
favorable or fatal.</p>

<p>Convalescence was always long, often
being complicated by diarrhœa or dropsy.
It has been remarked in this connection
that the malady might be confounded with
the miliary sweat observed in Picardy and
central France, but in the first named disease
no cutaneous eruption was observed.
Fernel clearly affirms this statement, as he
says: “In this affection there is no
carbuncle, bubo, exanthema nor eczema, but
simply a hypersecretion of sweat.”</p>

<p>Such was the sweating sickness of the
sixteenth century, which made so few
victims in France, but which destroyed so
many people in England and Germany.
The origin of this disease has been often
discussed, and also its nature; but all theories
emitted by various authors partake of
the doctrines of other days and are too
antiquated to be revamped. We will content
ourselves with saying that the classification
of periods made by us is logical,
and we consider the sweating sickness of
the fifteenth century as a pernicious fever,
in which the sweating stage predominated
and consequently became the characteristic
symptom of the affection.</p>


<h3>THE SCURVY.</h3>

<p>It has been supposed by many that
Hippocrates described scurvy under the
name of <i>enlarged spleen</i>, an affection attributed
to the use of stagnant water and characterized
by tumefaction of the gums, foul
breath, pale face, and ulceration of the
lower limbs. But the study of this Hippocratic
passage leads us to think that these
symptoms were more of the character of
scrofula than of scurvy. The recital by
Pliny of the diseases of the Roman soldiers
while on an expedition to Germany seems
to indicate scurvy, which Coelius Aurelianus,
and after him the Arabian physicians,
claims presented only a slight analogy
to that affection.</p>

<p>Springer thinks that we may find the
first traces of scurvy in the expedition of
the Normans to Wineland, in the first years
of the eleventh century. In admitting that
the men commanded by Eric Thorstein
were obliged to winter on the western
shores of Wineland and almost all succumbed
to an endemic malady of that
country, proves that it was nothing but
scurvy, although that word’s only signification,
in Danish, is ulceration of the
mouth.</p>

<p>We have, besides, another document,
which has great authentic value, a proof
transmitted to us by our earliest and best
chronicler of the Middle Ages, by Joinville,
the friend and companion of Saint
Louis in his Crusade into Palestine. In his
memoirs he gives a very succinct recital of
the epidemic of famine and scurvy which
attacked the French army on the banks of
the Nile in 1248, just after the battles of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>25</span>
Mansourah. Says Joinville: “After the
two battles just mentioned, commenced our
great miseries in the army; at the end of
nine days the bodies of our dead soldiers
arose to the surface of the water (their
tissues were corrupted and rotten), and
these corpses floated to a point between
our two camps (those of the King and the
Duke of Bourgogne), at a point where a
bridge touched the water. So many had
been slain that a great crowd of corpses
floated on the stream for a long distance.
The bodies of the dead Saracens were
sickening; the army servants threw open a
portion of the bridge and permitted the
dead infidels to float down the river, but
they buried the dead Crusaders in great pits
dug in the ground. I saw among other
dead the body of the Chamberlain of the
Count D’Artois, and many other friends
among the slain.</p>

<p>“The only fish we had eaten for four
months were of the variety called <i>barbus</i>,
and these <i>barbus</i> fed on the dead bodies,
and for this cause and other miseries of the
country where never a drop of rain fell
sickness entered our army of such a sort
that the flesh on the limbs dried and the
skin on the legs became black and like old
leather boots, and many sick rotted in their
groin; and all having the last named
symptom died. Another sign of death
was when the nose bled.”</p>

<p>The relation of Joinville leaves no
doubt as to the nature of the epidemic that
attacked the Crusaders. Here we have a
pen picture of the debility, the hemorrhages,
the livid ecchymosis of the skin,
the fungous tumefaction and bleeding of
the gums, which characterize the disease
known as scurvy.</p>

<p>According to the writings of some German
physicians of the fifteenth century,
this malady was endemic in the septentrional
portions of Europe upon the shores
of the Baltic Sea. In Holland numerous
epidemics of scurvy were observed among
the lower classes of the population, coinciding
with bad conditions of public
hygiene. Food consisting of salt and
smoked meats, dwellings located on marshy
ground, cold atmospheres charged with
fogs, etc., etc.</p>

<p>This was the same affection that attacked
our colonies in Canada, but at that
time we had no knowledge of the therapeutic
indications in such emergencies, and
quote as a proof of this a remarkable
observation inscribed on the registers of Cartier
on his vessels during his sojourn in
Canada: “The disease commenced in our
midst in a curious and unknown manner;
some patients lost their flesh and their
limbs grew black and swollen like charcoal,
and some were covered over with
bloody splotches like purpura; after which
the disease showed itself on the hips,
thighs, arms, and neck, and in all the
mouth was infected and rotten at the
gums, so that all the flesh fell off to the
roots of the teeth, which also most often
dropped out; and so terrible was this
plague that on my three ships by February
only ten healthy men were about out of a
crew of over a hundred.</p>

<p>“And, as the disease was unknown to
us, the Captain of the ships was asked to
open a few bodies to see if we could possibly
detect the lesion and thus be able to
protect the survivors. We found the hearts
of the dead to be white and withered, surrounded
by a rose colored effusion; the
liver healthy, but the lung black and mortified
and all its blood retired to the sac of
the heart. The spleen likewise was impaired
for about two finger-lengths as
though rubbed by a rough stone.”</p>

<p>From this autopsy rudely made<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> it is
true we discern most of the signs of
scrofula; a profound alteration of the
blood and an effusion of the liquids into
certain viscera, denoting a diminution in
the amount of fibrin and the number of
globules, alterations that also serve to explain
the tendency to hemorrhages observed
in very serious cases of scurvy.</p>


<h3>LEPROSY.</h3>

<p>Leprosy is a disease originating in the
Orient; Egypt and Judea were formerly
the principal infected centers. It was the
return of an expedition to Palestine, under
Pompey, that imported the malady to Italy.
In the first years of the Christian Era it is
mentioned by Celsus, who advised that it
should be treated by sweating, aided by
vapor baths. Some years later Areteus
used hellebore, sulphur baths, and the
flesh of vipers taken as food, a treatment
adopted by others, as, for instance, Musa
and Archigenes.</p>

<p>In the second century the disease was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>26</span>
in Gaul; Soranus treated the lepers of
Aquitaine, who were numerous.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>According to Velly, leprosy was common
in France in the middle of the eighth
century epoch, when Nicholas, Abbot of
Corbeil, constructed a leper hospital, which
was never much frequented until after the
Crusades of the eleventh and fourteenth
centuries. At this period the number of
lepers, or <i>ladres</i>, a name given to the unfortunates
in remembrance of their patron
saint, St. Lazarus, became so great that
every town and village was obliged to
build a leper house in order to isolate the
afflicted. Under Louis VIII. there were
2,000 of these hospitals; later the number
of such asylums reached 19,000.</p>

<p>According to the historians of this
time, when a man was suspected to be a
leper he could have no social relations
without making full declaration as to what
the real nature of his complaint might be.
Without this precaution his acts were void,
from the capitulary of Pepin, which dissolved
all marriage contracts with lepers,
to the law of Charlemagne, that forbade
their associating with healthy persons.
The fear of contagion was such that in
places where no leprosy existed they built
small houses for any one who might be
attacked; these houses were called <i>bordes</i>.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
A gray mantle, a hat and wallet, were also
supplied the victims, also a <i>tartarelle</i>, a
species of rattle, or a small bell, with
which they warned all passers near not to
approach. They also had a cup placed on
the far side of the road, in which all persons
might drop alms without going near
the leper.</p>

<p>Leper houses were enriched, little by
little, by the liberality of kings and nobles
and the people, and to be a leper became
less inhuman and horrible than at the beginning.</p>

<p>Lepers, however, were forced to submit
to severe police regulations. They
were forbidden under the severest penalties
from having sexual relations with healthy
persons, for such intimacy was considered
as the most dangerous method of conveying
the contagion. After entering a leper
house the victim was considered as dead
under the civil law, and in order to make
the patients better understand their position
the clergy accompanied them to their
asylum, the same as to their funeral, throwing
the cemetery dust on them while saying:
“Enter into no house save your asylum.
When you speak to an outsider
stand to the windward. When you ask
alms sound your rattle. You must not go
far from the asylum without your leper’s
robe. You must drink from no well or
spring save on your own grounds. You
must pass no plates nor cups without first
putting on your gloves. You must not go
barefooted, nor walk in narrow streets, nor
lean against walls, trees, or doors, nor
sleep on the edge of the road,” etc.</p>

<p>When dead they were interred in
the lepers’ cemetery by their fellow-sufferers.</p>

<p>Separated from society, these pariahs,
living together, sometimes reproduced
their own species, and finished their days
in the most frightful cachexia, awaking
only contempt, disgust, and repulsion
among the healthy of the outside world.</p>

<p>It is true that each time that sanitary
measures were relaxed by the authorities—such,
for instance, as the perfect isolation
of the patients—an increase in the number
of lepers was noticeable. When this was
observed the old-time ordinances were enforced
again with vigor. It was thus in
1371 the Provost of Paris issued an edict
enjoining all lepers to leave the Capital
within fifteen days, under heavy corporal
and pecuniary penalties; and in 1388, all
lepers were forbidden to enter Paris without
special permission; in 1402 this restriction
was renewed, “under penalty of being
taken by the executioner and his deputies
and detained for a month on a diet of
bread and water, and afterwards perpetual
banishment from the kingdom.” Finally,
in April, 1488, it was announced “all persons
attacked by that abominable, very
dangerous and contagious malady known
as leprosy, must leave Paris before Easter
and retire to their hospitals from the date
of issuance of this edict, under penalty of
imprisonment for a month on bread and
water; and, where they had property, the
sequestration of their houses and jewels
and arbitrary corporal punishment; it was
permitted them, however, to send things to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>27</span>
them by servants, the latter being in
health.”</p>

<p>We can understand from this how these
poor wretches, at different epochs, were
accused of horrible crimes, among other
things poisoning rivers, wells, and fountains.
As regards this accusation, says the
author of the <i>Dictionnaire des Mœurs des
Francais</i>, Philip le Long burned a certain
number of these poor devils at the stake
and confiscated their wealth, giving it to
the Order of Malta and St. Lazare.</p>

<p>The historians and chronicalers of the
eleventh and twelfth century often designated
the person attacked by leprosy by
the name of <i>mesel</i>, <i>mezel</i>, <i>meseau</i> or <i>mesiaus</i>.
Meantime Barbazin pretends that it is necessary
to make a distinction.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><i>Mesel</i>, according to Barbazin, was a
person covered with sores and ulcers, while
the leper was an insensible man. He
thinks that <i>mesellerie</i> was at its origin a different
affection than leprosy, and that these
two diseases have been wrongly confounded.
“They have both served,” says he,
“to designate a frightful disease, that is
reputed the most dangerous of all maladies.”</p>

<p>As supporting this assertion of Barbazin,
we have found in the Romanesque tongue
some documents strongly confirming this
point. They appear more interesting, inasmuch
as they have heretofore been unknown
to medical literature, as, for instance:</p>

<p>“Seneschal, I now demand of you,
said he (Saint Louis), which you love better,
whether you be <i>mesiaus</i>, or whether you
commit a mortal sin; and I, who never
have lied, responded that rather would I
commit thirty mortal sins than be <i>mesiaus</i>.”
(Joinville, <i>Histoire de Saint Louis</i>.)</p>

<p>The leprosy, however, was not an absolute
cause for divorce, as we note in the
following passage: “A man can leave his
wife only for fornication, and not alone
for leprosy, and lepers may marry; and
one may cancel marriage if the husband
become leper, and the same may be said
of the bride.”</p>

<p>In the same manuscript another
analogous fact shows the invalidation of the
marital act for the reason of <i>mesellerie</i> complicated
by impotence or barrenness.</p>

<p>“A woman who through impotence has
lost that which is necessary to her, so that
he cannot cohabit with her, for the reason
that he is <i>mesiaus</i>, may marry another, telling
the latter, however, that the first she
married was worth nothing, not even an
infant, as he could not cohabit; that nothing
can prevent cohabitation in marriage
nor the begetting of children.”</p>

<p>Individuals attacked by <i>mesellerie</i> were
in reality outside the pale of the law. For
we read in fact in the “<i>Coutume de Beauvoisis</i>,
cap. 39,” that “<i>mesiaus</i> must not be
called on as witnesses, for custom accords
them no place in the conversation of gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“The second reason is that when a
<i>mesiaus</i> calls on a healthy man, or when a
healthy man calls on a <i>mesel</i>, the <i>mesiaus</i>
may put in the defense that he is beyond
the reach of worldly law, and cannot be
held responsible in such a case.”</p>

<p>These unfortunates besides could not
inherit nor dispose of their own wealth
during their lives. The following passage
from the “ancient customs of Normandy”
bears witness, <i>i. e.</i>:</p>

<p>“The <i>mesel</i> can be no man’s heir from
the time his disease is developed, but he
may have a life interest, as though he were
not a <i>mesel</i>.”</p>

<p>The same as in many other diseases the
leprosy presented itself under different
forms and various degrees of gravity, as is
proved from the following passage from
<i>Le Pelerinage de l’humaine lignee</i>:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Entre le moienne et le meure.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This gravity of different forms of leprosy
has likewise been mentioned by the
Arabian school, and notably by Avicenna,
who had seen numerous cases complicated
with ulcerations of the genital organs; also,
by the Englishman, Gilbert, who wrote in
the thirteenth century regarding the existence
of several species of leprosy, which
could not always be easily distinguished by
reason of the uncertainty of their symptoms.
As to its character as a constitutional
malady we have the word of the
Syrian Jaliah ebn Serapion, who attributes
its connection to the predominance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>28</span>
certain humors; finally, Valescus of Tarentum
insists on the heredity of the disease.</p>

<p>The leprosy, the pork measles and the
<i>mesellerie</i> were then only clinical forms of a
single affection of a contagious nature—a
hereditary disease whose symptoms appeared
successively on the skin, in the
mucous membranes, the viscera and in the
nervous system. It then required a diathesis,
which resembled greatly in its evolution
that of syphilis, with which it has
often been confounded.</p>

<p>The physicians of leper hospitals have
left behind a great number of medical documents
bearing on the characteristics of
the disease, but their observations are so
confused that we can only conclude that
they considered all cutaneous maladies as
belonging to the same constitutional vice.</p>

<p>They recognized, however, the <i>ladrerrie</i>
(disease arising from measly pork), by the
following symptoms, the same being laid
down by Guy de Chauliac:</p>

<p>“Eyelids and eyebrows swollen, falling
of eye-lashes and eyebrows, which are replaced
by a finer quality of hair; ulceration
of septum of the nose, odor of ozoena,
granulated tongue, fœtid breath, painful
breathing, thickening and hardness of the
lips, with fissures and lividity of same;
gums tumefied and ulcerated; furfuraceous
scales in the hair, purple face, fixed expression,
hideous aspect; forehead smooth and
shiny like a horn; pustules on face; veins
on chest much developed; breasts hard.”</p>

<p>“Thinness of muscles of the hand,
especially thumb and index finger; lividity
and cracking of the nails; coldness of the
extremities; presence of a serpiginous
eruption; insensibility of the legs, collections
of nodosities around the joints; under
the influence of cold elevations appeared
on the cutis, making it appear like goose-skin.”</p>

<p>“Sensation of pricking, ulcerations of
skin; sleep uneasy, fetidity of sweat;
feeble pulse, bad odor of blood, which is
viscid and oily to the touch and gritty after
incineration, likewise of a violet black
color.”</p>

<p>The contagious characteristic of leprosy
through sexual relation was noticed by
physicians attached to hospitals, and was
the subject of police restriction by public
sanitary officers. Thus in the thirteenth
century the celebrated Roger Bacon, surnamed
the admirable doctor, wrote that
commerce with a leprous woman could be
followed by very serious consequences.
This opinion was corroborated by a physician
of the University of Oxford, his contemporary
John of Gaddsen, and by the
observations of Bernard Gordon, a celebrated
practitioner of Montpellier. We
all know the history of a Countess who
came to be treated for leprosy at Montpellier,
when a Bachelor in Medicine
charged with the task of dressing her sores,
fell desperately in love with the leper lady,
and from his <i>amours</i> contracted most serious
cutaneous disease.</p>

<p>At this period the leprosy had already
begun to assume a venereal type of marked
character, and many prostitutes suffered
from attacks. As we all are aware, Jean
Manardi, an Italian doctor, has fully expressed
his opinion on this subject. In a
letter addressed to a friend, Michel Santana,
one of the first specialists who treated
pox, Manardi remarks: “This disease
has attacked Valencia, in Spain, being
spread broadcast by a famous courtesan,
who, for the price of fifty crowns, accorded
her favors to a nobleman suffering from
leprosy. This woman having been tainted,
in her turn contaminated all the young
men who called on her, so that more than
four hundred were affected in a brief space
of time. Some of these, having followed
the fortunes of King Charles into Italy,
carried and spread this cruel malady in
their track.”</p>

<p>Another Italian physician, Andre
Mathiole, likewise shows the identity of
leprosy with syphilis,—in the following
terms: “Some authors have written that
the French have taken this disease from
impure commerce with leprous women
while traversing the mountains of
Italy.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>We could easily multiply such citations
to complete the facts observed by Fernel
and Ambroise Pare in France, and also by
many Italian physicians, from whence it
would be easy to understand why Manardi
came to the following conclusion: “Those
who have connection with a woman who
has had recent <i>amours</i> with a leper, a courtesan
in whose womb the seeds of disease
may linger, sometimes contract leprosy and
at other times suffer from other maladies of
a more or less serious nature, according to
their predispositions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>29</span></p>

<p>This modification from <i>measles</i> (the disease
from corrupt pork diet) into leprosy
of the venereal type is made progressively
through the intermediary of the ordinary
agencies of prostitution,—bawds and libertines,—who
for a very long period eluded
the wise laws ordained by sanitary police
for the restriction of lepers. In 1543, the
affection was so wide-spread as to be
beyond sanitary control, and the edict of
Francois I., re establishing leper hospitals,
amounted to nothing. There were too
many poxed people. The Hospital of
Lourcine, which was specially devoted to
these cases at Paris contained 600 patients
in 1540, and in the wards of Trinity
Hospital and the Hotel Dieu there were many
more. It was the same in the Provinces,
notably at Tolouse, which had the merit of
creating the first venereal hospital ever instituted,
under the Gascon name of “<i>Houspital
das rognousez de la rougno de Naples</i>.”
Finally, fifty years later, in 1606, for want
of lepers, the leper asylums were officially
closed. Henry IV., in a proclamation,
gave those remaining “to poor gentlemen
and crippled soldiers.”</p>

<p>Thus ended the epidemic of leprosy in
France, which had prevailed from the
second century, observing the same progress
in other countries of Western Europe
during the same period of time. Syphilis,
the product of the venereal maladies of
antiquity and the leprosy of the Middle
Ages, announced a new era; syphilis
was thus contemporaneous with the <i>Renaissance</i>.</p>

<p>In the collection of Guy Patin’s letters,
there is an interesting document relating to
the connection of leprosy and syphilis, as
witness the principal passage:</p>

<p>“It was not long since that I saw in
Auvergne a patient who was suspected of
measles (<i>hog disease</i>), for the reason that his
family had the reputation of being thus
afflicted, though he bore on his body no
marks of the disease. This led me to
recall the fact that some families in Paris
have been suspected of this taint; but
really we have no measles or leprosy here.
In former times there was a hospital dedicated
to such cases in the Faubourg Saint
Denis. I have noticed no cases in Champagne,
Normandy nor Picardy, although
in all these Provinces I found asylums
formerly used for such cases that are now
turned into hospitals for plague victims. In
former times leprosy was confounded with
pox, through the ignorance of doctors and
the barbarity of the age; nevertheless,
there are yet a few lepers in Provence,
Languedoc and Poitou.”</p>

<p>We have here the authority of Guy
Patin for saying that leprosy had almost
entirely disappeared from France in the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Although modern Faculties are prone
to insist that the real science of medicine
only dates back its origin to the discovery
of the microscope, and that the study of
antique medicine is only a retrospective
exposition calculated to show the slight
scientific value of ancient observations, I
assert that the many observations recorded
by our medical ancestors are of immense
value. Let us cite, as a single instance,
this transformation of a constitutional malady,
attenuated by time, transmitted by
heredity through the same masses of people
for ten centuries,—populations having a
similar diathesis,—a disease taking a new
vigor and attacking other generations, but
destined in a given time to disappear, most
probably, in its turn, in another unknown
metamorphosis. Such an idea may cause
a smile in that haughty <i>section hors rang</i> in
medicine, which is so devoted to the culture
of specific germs that but one idea can
certainly be adopted as an irrefutable
dogma in medicine—that is, if the facts it
represents coincide with the modifications
of the wag—in the tail end of a bacillus.</p>

<p>As for myself, I remain convinced that
everything seen in modern times, through
the objective even of an instrument of precision,
cannot destroy the accumulated
work of twenty centuries of medical observation
and study.</p>

<h3>THE SYPHILIS.</h3>

<p>If the true syphilis—the variety that
appeared in the fifteenth century—was unknown
in the Middle Ages, there still exist
documents which fully affirm the existence
of contagious venereal diseases several
hundreds of years before the Italian wars
of Charles VIII. and Louis XII. The
maladies which, in times of antiquity,
afflicted the Hebrews and Romans, as a
result of impure sexual commerce, are to-day
only the results of the progress made
by prostitution after the Crusades; that is
to say, they are merely the products of debauchery
and leprous virus imported from
the Orient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>30</span></p>

<p>As early as the twelfth century France
knew the <i>mal malin</i> or <i>mal boubil</i>, an affection
characterized by sores and ulcerations
on the arms and genital organs. Gauthier
de Coinci, Prior of the Abbey of St.
Medard de Soissons, at the beginning of
the thirteenth century considered these
maladies as impure and contagious, and
warned his priests in the following verselets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The monk, the church clerk and the priest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must not defile themselves the least,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But with good conscience and pure heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Keep their hands off from private part.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pray God at morning and at night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To hide corruption from their sight;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The <i>mal boubil</i> the <i>mal malan</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Comes ever to each sinning man.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We are permitted to suppose from these
lines that the disease was localized in “a
wicked place that the hands must not
touch,” and that it was only an affection of
the same nature as the <i>gorre</i> and <i>grand
gorre</i>, one of the numerous expressions applied
to all contagious maladies of the
sexual organs. This fact cannot be contested,
for at the same epoch, in a poem
entitled “<i>Des XXIII Manieres de Vilains</i>,”
we find an imprecation launched by this
anonymous author against all blackguards
and bawds:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That they may be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Itchy, poxed, and apostumed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Covered with ulcers, badly rheumed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full of fever, jaundice sapped,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That they may be, also, clapped.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or, as given in French:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Qu ils aient ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rogne, variole et apostume,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et si aient plente de grume,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Plente de fievre et de jaunisse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et si aient la chade-pisse”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, the opuscle, from which these
verses are derived, was reprinted in 1833
by Francisque Michel, and is contemporaneous
with the manuscripts of the thirteenth
century, analyzed by M. Littre in
<i>a note on syphilis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> where our erudite
author says: “At this epoch the venereal
diseases had an analogous form to those we
observe to-day.”</p>

<p><i>This document dates back 200 years before
the discovery of America</i>, and is duly authenticated
by the testimony of Guillaume
Saliceti, a physician and Italian priest of
the thirteenth century. “When a man
has received a corruption of the penis,
after having cohabited with an obscene
woman or for other cause, there comes a
tumor in the groin.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> And some years
after Lanfranc, a student of Salicetis,
wrote, in his turn, in his <i>Parva Cyrurgia</i>,
that “buboes appear following ulcers on
the penis.” His description of chancres
and other venereal accidents is very remarkable.</p>

<p>Another writer of the thirteenth century,
Michel Scott, a Scotch physician,
alchemist, and philosopher, who lived in
France and Germany for many years, says
in one of his numerous works:<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> “Women
become livid and have discharges. If a
woman is in such a condition and a man
cohabit with her his penis is easily diseased,
as we often see in adolescents who,
ignorant of this fact, often contract a sore
organ or are attacked by leprosy. It is
also well to know that if a discharge exist
at the epoch of conception, the fetus is
more or less diseased, and in this case a
man must abstain from all connection, and
the woman should resist sexual advances, if
she have foresight.”</p>

<p>This passage leaves no possible doubt
as to the existence of blenorrhagia with
the discharge and as to the presence of an
hereditary syphilitic diathesis, for if the
author gives the last-mentioned the name
of leprosy it is only for the reason that at
this period no positive term was in use to
designate venereal diseases,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> which were
confounded with leprosy, with or without
reason, the former only being, perhaps, a
transformation of the latter.</p>

<p>About a century later, that is to say, on
August 8th, 1347, Queen Jeanne of
Naples, Countess of Provence, sent to
Avignon the statutes relating to the establishment
of houses of prostitution in that
city. Article IV. of this law regulated
police measures in the following terms:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>31</span>
“The Queen ordains that every Saturday
the bailiff and a barber deputed by the
Councilmen shall visit every debauched
girl in the place, and if they find any one
who has the disease arising from venery,
that such a one may be separated from the
other girls and lodged apart, to the end
that no one may have commerce with her,
and that the young may thus avoid contracting
disease.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>These statutes were first made known
by Astruc,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and have been inserted without
reserve by Grisolle in his <i>Traite de
Pathologie Interne</i>; also by Cazenave in his
<i>Traite des Syphilides</i>; but Jules Courtet, and
after him Rabutaux and Anglada, have
considered these documents as somewhat
apocryphal.</p>

<p>We shall not stop to discuss the authenticity
of these documents; they have characteristics
that make their genuineness
almost indisputable. Besides, we can
quote other authors against whom no arguments
can be used; for instance, we will
cite John of Gaddesen, a physician of the
English Court, who affirmed that sexual
connection with a leprous woman produced
ulcers of the penis;<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> besides, his
compatriot Gilbert, who described in his
<i>Compendium Medicinal</i>, in the year 1300,
the treatment of gonorrhœa and chancre
so common after the Crusades; or Gui du
Chauliac, who in 1360 noticed “the ulcers
born of commerce with a tainted woman,
impure and chancrous (<i>ex coitu cum fœtida
vel immunda vel cancrosa muliere</i>).”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Again,
note Torella, of Italy, who considered pox
as a contagious malady which had existed
from times of antiquity, and which had
made its appearance at different epochs,
but of which the symptoms, poorly understood
by medical men, prevented isolation
and its proper pathological identity.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>We need not reproduce the text of all
the French and especially the Italian doctors,
who established the identity of venereal
diseases <i>before the year</i> 1494—such
writers as Montagnana, Petrus Pintor,
Nicolas Leonicenus, Joseph Grunpeck, etc.
As to these works, they have all been
mentioned by Fracastor, in his celebrated
<i>Treatise on Contagious Diseases</i> (<i>de morbis
contagiosis</i>), a work at once a fine poem,
whose Latinity is perfect and a monograph
of true scientific exactitude.</p>

<p>Fracastor described the patient as well
as the disease: “The victims were sad
and broken with pale faces.”</p>

<p>“They had chancres on their private
parts; these chancres were changeable;
when cured at one point they reappeared
at another; they always broke out
again.”</p>

<p>“Pustules with crusts were raised on
the skin; in some these commence on the
scalp first; this was the usual case; in a
few they appeared elsewhere. At first
these were small, afterwards increasing in
size, appearing like unto the milk crust in
children. In some these pustules were
small and dry—in others large and humid.
Sometimes they were scarlet, sometimes
white, sometimes hard and pink. These
pustules opened at the end of some days,
pouring out an incredible quantity of
stinking and nasty liquid, once opened they
became true phagedenic ulcers, which not
only consumed the flesh but even the
bone.”</p>

<p>“Those whose upper regions were attacked
had malignant fluxions, that eat
away the palate, the trachea, the throat and
the tonsils. Some patients lost their lips,
others their noses, others their eyes, others
their private parts.”</p>

<p>“Large gummy tumors appeared in
many and disfigured the limbs. These
growths were often the size of an egg or a
French roll of bread. When opened these
tumors discharged a whitish mucilaginous
liquid. They were principally noted on
the arms and legs; while ulcerating sometimes
they grew callous, at other times remaining
as tumors until death.”</p>

<p>“As if this were not sufficient, terrible
pains oftimes attacked the limbs; these
generally came when the pustules appeared.
These pains were long abiding and
well nigh insupportable, aching most at
night, not only affecting the articulation,
hut also the bones and nerves of the limbs.
Sometimes the patient had pustules without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>32</span>
pains, at other times pains without pustules;
but the great majority had pustules
and pains.”</p>

<p>“The patients were plunged into a
condition of languor. They became thin,
weak, without appetite, sleeping not,
always sad and in a sullen humor, the
face and the limbs swollen, with a slight
fever at times. Some suffered with pains
in the head, pains of long duration, which
did not recede before any remedies.”</p>

<p>“Although the greater majority of mortals
have taken this disease by contagion,
it is no less certain that a great number of
others contracted it from infection. It is
impossible to believe, in fact, that in such
a short time the contagion that marches so
slowly by itself and which is communicated
with such difficulty, should overrun such a
number of countries, after having been (as
it is claimed), imported by a single fleet of
Spanish ships. For it is well known that
its existence was determined in Spain,
France, Italy and Germany and all through
Scythia at the same period of time. Without
doubt the malady originated spontaneously,
like the petechial fever, or it had
always existed.”</p>

<p>“A barber, my friend, has a very old
manuscript, containing directions for the
treatment of the affection. This has for
its title: ‘<i>Medicine for the thick scabs, with
pains in the joints.</i>’ The barber remembered
the remedy laid down in this work,
and at the very commencement of the new
malady thought he recognized the contagion
by the name of the <i>thick</i> scabs. But
physicians having examined this remedy
found it too violent, inasmuch as it was
composed of quicksilver and sulphur. He
would have been happier had he not consulted
the doctors; he would have grown
wealthy by incalculable gains.”</p>

<p>We see from this that the syphilis of
the fifteenth century did not present precisely
the same symptoms as the variety of
to day. Formerly secondary and tertiary
accidents supervened much more rapidly,
besides being very violent in their manifestations.
Besides the disease was exceedingly
malignant often causing, death in a
short time, which fact led many authors of
that epoch to consider the symptoms due
to a pestilence brought about by general
causes.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Nicholas Massa wrote in fact,
that: “The patient has pains in the head,
arms, and especially the legs, which are
always intensified at night. The buboes
in the two groins are salutary when they
suppurate. We observe a chafed and
scaly condition of the palms of the hands
and soles of the feet. Ulcers of a bad appearance
are frequently noted on the
penis; these ulcers are hard and callous
and very slow in healing. In exploring
the throat we often discover a relaxed condition
of the uvula and the presence of sordid
ulcers, which rarely suppurate. With all
this eruptive process we note certain hard
tumors that adhere to the skin and bone
and bear the name of <i>gummata</i>. These
tumors may ulcerate and produce osseous
caries.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>We notice the same errors in all the
descriptions given by the authors of the
sixteenth century; they exhibit an imperfect
knowledge of the symptomatology, of
the genesis and primitive constitutional
accidents. We see that as yet clinical
medicine had no existence, and that our
predecessors were ignorant of the art of co-ordinating
the signs of a disease in a
thoughtful manner. Nevertheless, their
descriptive powers in writing on venereal
diseases, as before noted, were excellent,
and had the merit of exactitude and honest
observation; as, Pierre Manardi observes:
“The principal sign of the French disease
consists in pustules coming out on the end
of the penis in men and at the entrance of
vulva or neck of womb among women.
Most frequently these pustules ulcerate; I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>33</span>
say frequently for the reason that I have
seen patients in whom these ulcers were
hard as warts, cloves or apple seeds.”</p>

<p>Here we have the aspect of primary
syphilis presented by a physician whose
name will, with justice, remain attached to
the disease as long as it has a history. The
secondary symptoms of the malady have
never been more dramatically pictured
than by Fernel, who remarks: “They had
horrible ulcers on them, which might be
mistaken for glands, judging from size and
color, from which issued a foul discharge
of a villainous infecting kind, enough to
give a heart-ache; they had long faces of
a greenish-black complexion, so covered
with sores that nothing more hideous could
be imagined.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Relative to the duration of secondary
symptoms, under date of 1495, Marcello
de Cumes wrote from the camp of Novarro
that “the pustules on the face, like those
of leprosy and variola, lasted a year or
more when the patient was not treated.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The physiognomy of the unfortunates
whose faces were adorned with lumps and
whose foreheads bore the sadly characteristic
<i>corona veneris</i>, has been well described
in the following verses by Jean Lemaire,
of Belgium, a poet and historical writer of
fifteenth century. The portrait is exact:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But in the end, when the venom is ripe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sprout out big warts of a scarlet type,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Persistent, spreading over the face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leaving the brand of shame and disgrace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An injury left after passion’s rude storm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fair human nature thus to deform.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">High forehead, neck, round chin and nose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many a warty sore disclose;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the venom, with deadly pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Runs through the system in every vein,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Causing innumerable ailments, no doubt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From itch to the ever-tormenting gout,” etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Meantime, the symptoms of syphilis
were not long in losing some of their acute
features. Already, in 1540, Antoine Lecocq
noted this fact in France:<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> “Sometimes,”
says he, “the virus seems to expend
its strength on the groins in tumefaction
of the glands; and, if this bubo
suppurates, it is well. This tumor we call
bubo; others call it <i>poulain</i> (colt or filly)
for mischief’s sake, as those who are thus
attacked separate their legs while walking,
horse style.” Fernel declared that the
venereal disease at the end of the sixteenth
century so little resembled that of his early
days that he could scarcely believe it the
same. He remarks: “This disease has
lost much of its ferocity and acuteness.”</p>

<p>On his part, Fracastor remarked, in
1546, that “For six years past the malady
has changed considerably. We now notice
pustules on but few patients, and they
have but few pains, and these are generally
slight; but more gummy tumors are observed.
A thing that astonishes the world
is the falling out of the hair of the head
and baldness in other portions of the body.
It sometimes happens that in the worst
cases the teeth become loose and even fall
out.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>These phenomena were evidently due
to the action of mercurial ointment, which
was much used in Italy from the time it
was recommended by Hugo, of Boulogne,
in the <i>malum mortuum</i>, or malignant leprosy
of the Occident. In France guaiac was
much used, or holy wood, which was then
known as <i>sanctum lignum</i>, when only the
Latin equivalent was in vogue. Besides,
mention is made of mercurial stomatitis
following inunctions with the so-called
Neapolitain ointment in the Prologue of
<i>Pantagruel</i>, by Rabelais.</p>

<p>This passage from Dr. Francis Rabelais<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
leads us to think that physicians
were undecided about caring for syphilitic
patients in the fifteenth century, almost all
doctors, in fact, refusing to examine into
the character of a disease of which they
knew nothing; a disease whose infecting
centers were the most degraded and ignoble
public places; a malady not described
in the works of Hippocrates nor Galen.</p>

<p>So, this <i>lues venerea</i>, as it is called by
Fernel, made numerous victims in all
countries. It spread in the towns and
throughout the rural districts, and, at
times, caused such ravages that, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>34</span>
large cities, the authorities were obliged to
use sanitary measures against the pox, as
had been done at other times in the case
of leprosy. Syphilitics were expelled from
places and forbidden, under severe penalties,
from having intercourse with healthy
people. But it soon came to be known
that contagion could only occur through
sexual connection, and the patients then
hid in hospitals, where they were specially
treated by the methods laid down by the
first syphilographers,—vapor baths, mercurial
inunctions, frictions, etc. Unfortunately,
no prophylactic measures were
instituted against prostitutes, although they
were recognized as having a monopoly in
venereal disorders; for they did not believe
at that time, like Jean de Lorme, who said:
“The pox may be caught by touching an
infected person; by breathing the same air;
by stepping, barefooted, in the patient’s
sputa, and in many other manners.”</p>

<p>Even the poets wrote sonnets, poems
and ballads upon this <i>mal d’amour</i> (lovesickness).
One could form an immense
volume by collecting all the verses written
and published on this subject during the
sixteenth century. But no poem indited
during that period presents so great an
interest to medical science as the ballad of
Jean Droyn, of Amiens, dedicated to the
Prince, in which the author, stronger in
the etiology of syphilis than the doctors of
his time, advised young men who feared
<i>grosse verole</i> (the pox) not to indulge in
<i>liasons</i> with girls of the town without first
being satisfied with their pathological innocence.</p>

<p>This ballad was published at Lyons in
1512, that is to say, seventeen years after
the appearance of the disease in the army
of Charles VIII., at an epoch when the
majority of doctors considered the affection
as an infectious malady due to the
action of a pestilential miasm in the air.
We shall reproduce but a few lines of this

<p>In the final stanzas of this poem, which

owing to a maudlin sentimentality existing
in modern times, we find that the Prophet

we read:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the undoubted proof
of the antiquity of venereal diseases, Astruc,
as we all know, defends the American
origin of the malady, and endeavors to
support his views on the hypothesis emitted
by Ulrich de Hutten in 1519, <i>i.e.</i>, at
the siege of Naples, at the end of 1494, a
Spanish army commanded by Gonsalva of
Cordova came to the rescue of the besieged.
Their soldiers communicated to
the girls of the town and the courtesans of
the neighborhood the <i>maladie Americaine</i>
(American disease), which was contracted
in turn, after the capture of Naples, by the
army of King Charles, and afterwards
spread throughout France. But history informs
us that the King of France did not
return to Paris with his troops from the
Italian campaign until the month of
March, 1496. Now it was on the 6th of
March, in this same year, that Parliament
issued a proclamation regulating the pox,
in which the first section reads: “To-day,
the 6th of March, whereas in the City of
Paris a disease of a certain contagious
character, known as <i>verole</i> (pox), prevails,
the which has made much progress in the
Realm the past two years, as well at Paris
as in other places, and there is reason to
fear, this being Springtime, that it may increase,
it is deemed expedient to take cognizance
of the same.”</p>

<p>Other testimony is gathered from the
narrative of the voyages of Christopher
Columbus by his contemporary Petrus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>35</span>
Martyr, of Anghierra, historian attached
to the court of Ferdinand and Isabella.
According to the notes given him by the
great navigator on his return to Spain,
authentic records kept from day to day,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
the Spanish and Italian sailors of Columbus
found “people who lived in the Age of
Gold; with no ditches, no fences, no
books, no laws. The men were entirely
naked, the women only protected by a
belly-band of light material; notwithstanding
all this, their morals were pure.” Besides,
Petrus Martyr (<i>La Syphilis au XV.
Siecle</i>) proves there was syphilis in Spain
in 1487.</p>

<p>When Columbus returned to Europe
a second time he left behind him, under
orders of his brother, a hundred of his
companions in arms, who were a collection
of adventurers from all the nations of the
earth. These men committed all sorts of
excesses among the unfortunate Indians—steeping
themselves in lust and every manner
of crime, violating the women, and
indulging in wholesale debauchery. Says
Charles Renaut: “Looking at matters
from this standpoint, I am ready to believe
that the Spaniards carried the disease
to the natives of Hispanola, and that the
latter did not give the malady to the Spanish.”</p>

<p>We shall not dwell further on the origin
of syphilis, nor its connection with
leprosy and other cutaneous maladies
which were so prevalent in Europe throughout
the Middle Ages. We may consider
the disease as something new, and trace its
period of invasion and development to the
discovery of America, or assert that it
arose from a semi extinct affection (leprosy),
assuming a new type under the
influence of a special epidemic constitution.</p>

<p>One thing is clearly proven, <i>i.e.</i>, that
syphilis was preceded by contagious venereal
affections, which lost the irregular and
malignant forms of the fifteenth century.
When then the civilized nations of earth
create a true Public Health Service, syphilis
will be vanquished, and will pass away
to the ranks of other extinct maladies.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DEMONOMANIA_OF_THE_MIDDLE_AGES">THE DEMONOMANIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES.</h2>
</div>


<h3>ORIGIN OF MAGIC AND SORCERY</h3>

<p>From the day that Louis XIV. dissolved
the Parliament of Rouen, which
had condemned several persons in the
Province of Vire to death for the crime of
sorcery, but few sorcerers have been seen
in France.</p>

<p>It was in 1682 that Urbain Grandier
was tortured and burned alive for having
launched a malediction against the Ursulines
of Loudun.</p>

<p>A violent reaction occurred against the
Inquisitors, theologians, and their accomplice
butchers, thanks to the courageous
intervention of eminent philosophers and
savants, who were justly indignant at the
crimes of the Roman Catholic priesthood.
This reaction clearly demonstrated the fact
that the innumerable victims of religious
intolerance in the Middle Ages were not
sorcerers, nor possessed of the devil, nor
minions of Hell. Psychologists and moralists
claimed that the victims of these delusions
were insane, persons suffering from
semi delusions, subjects of monomania.
Science classed these unfortunates into
several groups, among which may be
enumerated persons afflicted with hallucinations,
demonomaniacs, erotomaniacs,
subjects of lycanthropy, etc., without
counting vampires, choreomaniacs, lypemaniacs,
and others whose attacks are
recognized by medical science.</p>

<p>The encyclopedists and their disciples
declared themselves satisfied, inasmuch as
psychological experts had done away with
the absurd traditions of the Middle Ages
as well as antique superstitions. The
death penalty for demonidolatry was removed,
but the doors of the insane asylum
opened for its followers.</p>

<p>Could any better arrangement have
been made at the present day? Let us
take the history of this famous epidemic of
demonidolatry of other days and examine
the documentary evidence offered against
those accused of the crime of sorcery, passing
the testimony through the crucible of
modern science, pathology, physiology,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>36</span>
together with all observable symptoms, holding
in view meanwhile modern neurological
discoveries; let us strive, in a word, to
solve this great psychological question,
which has greatly agitated the human
understanding for four hundred years
past.</p>

<p>We believe <i>what is, is the truth</i>, and in
order to best judge the facts narrated, it is
well to first arrange our knowledge as to
the psychological condition of Occidental
populations during the Middle Ages, a condition
that was only the continuation of the
ideas and traditions of antiquity, modified
by the fanatical prejudices of a new religion
and by a cruel and barbarous social
Constitution.</p>

<p>If history authorizes us, in fact, to conclude
that the occult sciences have existed
from the earliest periods of antiquity, that
the people who brought learning from the
Orient to the Occident, have at all times
admitted the existence of genii, angels, and
demons, it is easy to explain the action
that such mysterious traditions would have
on the ignorant minds of the peasantry of
the Middle Ages, bowed under the yoke of
slavery to feudal Lords and the clerical despotism
of the Romish Church.</p>

<p>Let us interrogate these historical texts
with impartiality, and analyze these ancient
theogonies, which are, so to speak,
the <i>proces verbaux</i> of the philosophic development
of the human mind, and we shall
see whether we can admit that mental diseases
may prevail <i>epidemically</i> for several
generations, like the pestilential maladies
of the fourth century, for example.</p>

<p>We know that it was in India, the
cradle of human genius, that the doctrine
of supernaturalism, of good and bad
spirits exerting an occult influence on mankind,
was born. Ancient history shows
such a belief goes back to antique times.
Zoroaster, inspired by <i>Ahura Mazda</i>, the
Omniscient, wrote, in the Zend Avesta, the
text and commentaries of the religious law
dedicated to the Aryas of India and Persia.
This law had for its object the destruction
of the cult of <i>dews</i> or demons,
who infested the earth under human forms,
and also to repress the naturalistic instinct
of the most ancient people of <i>Asia</i>, by
initiating them in a faith for Celestial
genii.</p>

<p>The disciples of Zoroaster were the
<i>Magi</i>; that is to say, the learned men of
the day, but they modified the doctrine of
the Prophet, which the Guebres alone preserved
in its purity, with the fundamental
doctrine of the dualism of light and darkness,
represented by <i>Ormazd</i> and <i>Ahriman</i>,
the spirit of the blest and the spirit of the
damned.</p>

<p>The Chaldeans, celebrated from times
of antiquity for their knowledge, not only
of astronomy, but all other sciences, adopted
the doctrines of the Zend-Avesta, and
their Magi transmitted the same to the
Egyptians, Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans,
and finally to the Gauls, whose
adepts were the Druids.</p>

<p>The science or Magic of the Chaldeans
was only magnetism, somnambulism, and
spiritism.</p>

<p>Says M. F. Fabart: “The Magi, according
to certain <i>bas reliefs</i> exhumed in
Oriental countries, knew the virtue of magnetic
passes. We see figures with hands
extended, influencing by their gestures the
subjects, who, seated before them, have
closed eyes.</p>

<p>“The Pythonesses and Sybills did not
have the power of foresight until they had
passed through the crisis of an artificial
somnambulism, and we find passages in
antique authorities where this imposed
sleep is discussed.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>In one of my preceding works I have
spoken of several very curious passages in
the <i>Pharsalia</i> of Lucan, where he speaks
of the oracles of the female magician
Erichto and the responses of the Pythonesses
in the Temple of Delphi to the inquiries
of Appius. Cassandra, priestess to
Apollo in the tragedy of Agamemnon, by
Seneca the tragedian, is a perfect type of
the hypnotizable hysteric, and, if the poet
does not describe the methods followed by
the priests of the temple in order to magnetize
their subjects, we find them noted
by other Latin authors in terms so explicit
as to leave no doubt as to their knowledge
of magnetic passes (hypnotism).</p>

<p>Says Cœlius Aurelianus: “We make
circular movements with the hands before
the eyes of the patient. Under our
gaze the subject follows the movements of
our hands, the eyes blinking.” It is while
giving the treatment for catalepsy that the
Roman physician, the contemporary of
Galen, initiates us in magnetic practice.
After giving a description of the neurosis,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>37</span>
which he characterizes by prostration, immobility,
rigidity of neck, loss of voice,
stupor of the senses, widely opened eyelids,
fixity of the eyes and ocular expression,
the Latin author teaches us how to
relieve the disease and partially waken the
movement, senses, and intelligence of the
patient; and he magnetizes, as is clearly
indicated in the following lines: “<i>Atque
ita, si ante oculos eorum quisquam digitos
circum moveat, palpebrant ægrotantes, et suo obtutu
manuum trajectionem sequuntur; vel si
quicquam profecerint etiam toto obtutu converso
attendunt; et inclamati, respicientes lacrymantur
nihil dicentes, sed volentium respondere
vultum æmulantes</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The precepts of Zoroaster were differently
modified among ancient people.
Moses, who wished the glory of being the
great prophet of Israel, wrote the law of
Jehovah and abjured the Magi, by whom
he had been initiated. The Hebrews
meantime preserved the Mazadean religion
in memory; they created magic. Ahriman
became Astaroth, Beelzebub, Asmodeus
and other demons, who had for interpreters
the Pythonesses and Prophetesses (<i>mediums</i>).
Ormazd was transferred into a
legion of angels and archangels, who
appeared to men to make prophecies.
Presently the Jewish magicians invented
the <i>Kabbala</i>, occult science, by which, in
pronouncing certain words, they performed
miracles and submitted supernatural
powers to the caprices of the
human will; they were above all necromancers.</p>

<p>The occult sciences of the ancients, necromancy
and magic, had, as will be observed,
more or less connection with the
phenomena of magnetism of the present
day. Meantime necromancy resembled
modern spiritualism, toward which the researches
of present day magnetizers tend.
The necromancers invoked the souls of
the dead to know the future and the secrets
of the present. The Jews pursued this
study with much ardor, notwithstanding
the prohibition of Moses, who wished them
not <i>to speak to wood</i>. We know that the
Pythoness (<i>witch</i>) of Endor evoked the
spirit of Samuel before Saul on the eve of
battle and predicted the King’s death. The
grotto where this celebrated medium lived
still exists, and she receives, it is said, the
travelers who visit her from far and wide
near Mount Tabor.</p>

<p>Magic was also known by the High
Priests in Pharaoh’s court. Like the Magi
of Medea and Chaldea they invoked the
spirits and supernatural powers by methods
and ceremonies consisting principally of
gestures and songs.</p>

<p>Hermes Trismegistus, whom the Alchemists
regard as their master, spread the
science of occult magic. Following him
we see the mystical doctrines of the Orient
flourish at Alexandria with the founders of
neoplatonism. These taught that the
<i>Goetie</i> was the supernatural art which is
practiced by the aid of wicked spirits, that
the <i>Magie</i> produced mysterious manifestations
with the assistance of material demons
and superior spirits; that the <i>Pharmacists</i>
controlled spirits by means of philters
and elixirs.</p>

<p>In Greece and in Italy the celestial
genii were believed in, and they multiplied
to infinity, peopling the Olympus of Polytheism.
Priests profited by the superstitious
idea of the people who invoked the
aid of the witches and sibyls who derived
their wisdom from the Magi of the Orient.
Following the example, the historians,
philosophers and poets were apparently led
to the belief in all the Genii, in the power
of spirits and their intimate relations with
men through the medium of seers, in a
condition of frenzy or somnambulism
(trance).</p>

<p>We know that the poet Hesiodus in his
theogony, that Plato, from the time of his
initiation with the Hermetic doctrines, that
Aristotle in his philosophical works, all admit
the existence of immaterial beings interesting
themselves in the affairs of
humanity. The Pythagorians, on their
side, affirmed their power of controlling
demons by keeping themselves in constant
meditation, abstinence and chastity.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>38</span></p>

<p>During all times of antiquity, there were
corporations of priests, philosophers, theosophists,
thaumaturgists and other sects,
who exercised the trade of invoking spirits
by conjuring them with charms, by enchantments
and witchcraft, and changing
by their aid the laws of nature, to command
the elements and accomplish other extraordinary
feats. In order to do these prodigies
they had recourse to cabalistic formulæ,
indicated in conjuring books, or by
incantations, magical circles, or simply by
magnetic power.</p>

<p>Simon of Samaria, Circe, Medea,
Plotinus, Porphyrius, Jamblichus, and the
famous Canidie, so justly cursed by Horace,
belonged to this clan of magicians,
gnostics, enchanters and mediums, who
acquainted the people with the occult arts
of the magi of Chaldea. It is only necessary
to study history to be convinced of
this fact.</p>

<p>Damis, the historian and pupil of Apollonius
of Tyana, has left us the biography
of his master, the most remarkable thaumaturgist
of antiquity. It is in this work
that he shows that while Apollonius was
lecturing on philosophy at Ephesus, he
stopped in the midst of his speech and
cried out to the murderer who, at the same
moment, assassinated Domitian at Rome,
“Courage, Stephanus; kill the tyrant!”
Apollonius had sojourned long in India,
and all his disciples have attested the marvelous
things he could do. He cured incurable
diseases and made other miracles
that astonished his contemporaries who
were partisans, like himself, of the doctrines
of Pythagoras.</p>

<p>Porphyrius published the fifty-four
treatises of his master Plotinus, the illustrious
neoplatonist, a work in which we find all
the ideas of contemporaneous experimental
psychology and a mystical philosophy supported
on extasy, contemplation and hypnotism—ideas
which were again enunciated
one day by the enchanter Merlin, Albertus
Magnus, Pic de la Mirandolle, Lulle,
Cornelius Agrippa, Count Saint Germain,
Joseph Balsamo, Robert Fludd, Richard
Price and the <i>freres</i> of <i>Rose Croix</i>.</p>

<p>But, before these, there were others
who believed they preserved the mysterious
secrets of nature, the Illuminati, the seers
and others not our immediate ancestors;
the Druids in the dark forests of Gaul,
along with the Druidesses. Both classes
belonged to the Sacerdotal order, and only
received the vestures of their sacred ministry
after twenty years consecrated to the
study of astrology, laws of nature, medicine
and the Kabbala. Their theodicy
taught the existence of one God alone and
the immateriality of the spirit, called after
death to be reincarnated an indetermined
number of times up to the point when perfection
was obtained; when a new, more
divine and happy distinction was achieved.
It admitted as a principal religious dogma
the ascendant metempsychosis, as in the
case of the first magi and the great Greek
philosophers; also a multitude of genii and
superior spirits intermediate between the
Divinity and mankind.</p>

<p>The <i>Druids</i> were not only the priests,
but dictators of Gaul; they were assisted
in their functions by the <i>Eubages</i>, the
soothsayers and sacrifices of their religion,
by the <i>Bards</i>, the poets and heralds, and
the <i>Brenns</i>, who participated in supreme
power. Druidism was then an admixture
of warlike ideas of the first inhabitants of
Gaul, together with the doctrines imported
by the Magii from Chaldea. So the
Druids were the astronomers, physicians,
surgeons, priests and lawgivers. The
Druidesses, descendants of the Pythonesses
and Sibyls of the Orient, spoke in oracles
and predicted the future; their influence
was considerable and often surpassed that
of the Druid priests themselves, for they
knew just as well how to use the Kabbala
and magic; and besides, as virgins, consecrated
depositaries of the secrets of
God, they stood high in the eyes of the
people. It is for this reason that the
Druids and Druidesses were, under Roman
domination, the defenders of national independence;
but, forced to take refuge in
dense forests far removed from the people,
persecuted by the Romans, barbarians and
Christians, they progressively became
magicians, enchanters, prophets and charmers,
condemned by the Councils and banished
by civil authority.</p>

<p>It is at this epoch that evil spirits were
noticed prowling around in the shadows of
night and indulging in acts of obscene depravity.
There were the <i>Gaurics</i>, beings
the height of giants; the <i>Suleves</i>, beardless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>39</span>
personages who were succubi, attacking
travelers; and the <i>Dusiens</i> were incubi,
demons who deflowered young girls during
their maiden slumbers.</p>

<p>Saint Augustin accorded his belief to
all these fables, which were retailed throughout
the country, affirming that we have no
right to question the existence of these
demons or libertine spirits, which make
impure attacks on persons while asleep.
(<i>Hanc assidue immunditiam et tentare et
efficere</i>,—Saint Augustin, in his “City of
God.”)</p>

<p>Decadence slowly ensued, so that in
the seventh century Druidism disappeared,
but the practice of magic, occult art, and
the mysterious science of spirits were
transmitted from generation to generation,
but lessened in losing the philosophic
character of ancient times. In a word,
magic became sorcery, and its adepts were
no longer recruited save in the infamous
and ignorant classes of society. The adoration
of nature and God, the immortality
of the soul, the grand ceremonies held at
the foot of gigantic oak trees, gave way to
hideous demons, gross superstitions, witchcraft,
and the most immoral abberations.
Occultism still subjugated the masses, but
the science had fallen into the hands of the
profane and of charlatans.</p>


<h3>THE THEOLOGIANS AND DEMONOLOGICAL
JUDGES.</h3>

<p>Magic, or the science of magic, then
served as a basis, as we have said before,
for mythology and legends and was noticeable
in the dogmas of all religions, for, as
Saint Augustin observes, “In order to
penetrate the mystical senses of fictions
and allegories, and the parables contained
in sacred history, it is necessary to be
versed in the study of occult science, of
which numerals make part.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>But from the Greek dæmon, or the
<i>Sapiens</i> of Plato, Christianity made a
demon, a fallen angel, who wished to people
his empire with the souls of the unbaptized;
he is borrowed from the Jews with
Beelzebub, Asmodeus, Satan, and their
numerous colleagues. After Jesus, who
was tempted by the Devil, and who delivered
those possessed by devils, we see the
apostles and saints visited in turn by the
angels of God and also by spirits of evil,
who fight battles among spiritual armies.
These are only visions, apparitions of
angels or demons who are vanquished
before the anointed of the Lord.</p>

<p>Mankind wished to participate in the
honors and emotions of communicating
with supernatural beings; it is for this purpose
that humanity addressed magicians
and practitioners of Occultism. So we
see in the first ages of Christianity the
Bishops were uneasy in regard to magicians
by reason of the popularity of the latter,
notwithstanding the peasantry had submitted
to the dogmas of the Church.</p>

<p>Paul Lacroix, the learned bibliophile,
cites as the most ancient monument made
mention of in this connection, an aggregation
of shadowy women collected for a
mysterious purpose, who devoted themselves
to making magical incantations; this
fragment is gathered from the Canons of a
Council which, he thinks, was held before
the time of Charlemagne. It treats of
aerial flights that these sorcerers made, or
thought they made, in company with
Diana and Herodias, <i>i.e.</i>, “<i>Illiud etiam non
est omitendum quod quædam sceleratæ mulieres,
retro post Satanam conversæ, demonum illusionibus
et phantasmatibus seductæ, credunt et
profitentur se nocturnis horis, cum Diana, dea
paganorum, vel cum Herodiate et innumera
multitudine mulierum, equitare super quasdam
bestias, et multarum terrarum spacia intempestæ
noctis silentio pertransire ejusque jussionibus
velut dominæ obedire, et certis noctibus ad
ejus servitium evocari</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Which, being freely translated, reads:
“We must not forget that impious women
devoted to Satan, were seduced by apparitions,
demons and phantoms, and avowed
that during the night they rode on fantastic
beasts along with Diana, a Pagan goddess,
or Herodias and an innumberable throng
of women. They pretended to traverse
immense space in the silence of the night,
obeying the orders of the two demon-women
as those of a sovereign, being
called into their service on certain given
occasions.”</p>

<p>We can understand from this that if
Christianity silenced Pagan oracles, it did
not authorize magicians to put the spiritual
world aside. The clergy accepted the
evidence of the witnesses of grace, but refused
that of the profane, who were only
inspired by demons; they recognized in
the latter the power of giving men illusions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>40</span>
of the senses, of cohabiting with virgins
under the form of <i>incubi</i> and with men
under the form of <i>succubi</i>,—demons who
could insinuate themselves through natural
orifices into all the cavities of the body,
and possess mortals.</p>

<p>Theologians have described all the pains
endured by those possessed,—pangs in
their thoracic and abdominal organs which,
made by the demons, forced their victims
to speak, sing, move, to be in a condition
of anæsthesia or hyperæsthesia, following
the imp’s will; in other words, the possessed
were subject to infernal action. To
the worship of spirits the first Bishops of
the Church substituted a foolish fear of
demons.</p>

<p>From this exaggeration of the power of
evil genii over man surged the silly terrors
and superstitious fears of damnation, which
were the starting-point of aberration among
the first demonomaniacs. It was for these
unfortunates that the clergy invented exorcisms
and great annual ceremonies destined
to deliver those possessed by demons,
ceremonies at which the Bishops convened
the people and the nobles to assist, in
order to show the triumphs of the Church
over Satan and his imps.</p>

<p>The theatrical arrangement of these
assemblages certainly induced some apparent
cures—making the faithful cry out “a
miracle, truly;” but who does not know
that all affections of the nervous system
love to be treated at the hands of thaumaturgists?
To invent demons to have the
glory of defeating them and to deliver
mankind from their influence,—such
appears to have been the objective point
of the primitive Christian Church. This
was certainly a clever trick in theological
magic, and, if the end did not seem to
justify the means to critical philosophic
eyes, we may admit, at least, that it was
better to exorcise the possessed than to
burn them alive at the stake, as was done
some centuries later.</p>

<p>“This doctrine of demons was so intimately
intermixed with the dogmas of this
perfected religious system by the Fathers
of the Church,” says Sprengel, that “it is
not astonishing authors attributed many
phenomena of nature to the influence of
demons.” One of the most celebrated
doctors of the Church, Origen, of Alexandria,
in his <i>Apology for Christianity</i>, remarks:
“There are demons that produce
famines, sterility, corruption of the air,
epidemics; they flutter surrounded by
fogs in the lower regions of the atmosphere,
and are drawn by the blood of their
victims in the incense that the pagans
offer them as their Divinity. Without the
odor of sacrifice, these demons could not
preserve their influence. They have the
most exquisite senses, are capable of the
greatest activity, and possess the most extended
experience.”</p>

<p>Saint Augustin had already written that
demons were the agents of the diseases of
Christians, and attacked even the new-born
who came to receive baptism.</p>

<p>The Church taught that these demons
acted through the intermediary of fallen
creatures who were in revolt against God
and his holy ministers. Such were the
sorcerers and female mediums, who were
met among ruins, in rocky cavern, and in
other hidden and obscure places. For a
morsel of bread or a handful of barley
such creatures could be consulted; one
could demand from them the secrets of the
future, instruments for revenge, charms to
secure love.</p>

<p>Among these sorcerers there were
old panderers, who knew, from personal
experience, all practices of debauchery,
and who gave the name of
<i>vigils</i> to the saturnalia indulged in among
villagers on certain nights, gatherings composed
of bawds and pimps, to which were
invited numerous novices in libidinousness.
These sorcerers and witches also knew the
remedies that young girls must take when
they wish to destroy the physiological results
of their imprudences, and what old
men need to restore their virility. They
knew the medicinal qualities of plants,
especially those that stupified. Perhaps a
few of these sorcerers discovered, from
magical incantations, the epoch of deliverance
from Feudal morals, the abolition of
servitude, equality and liberty. One thing
is certain, however, <i>i.e.</i>, that the clergy
saw nothing in them save enemies of the
Church and religion, creatures who were
dangerous to society and deserving only
destruction, <i>per fas et nefas</i>, by exorcism,
by fire—indeed, even by the accusations
tortured out of insane persons.</p>

<p>Thus, Pope Gregory IX., in a letter
addressed to several German Bishops in
1234, described the initiation of sorcerers
as follows: “When the master sorcerers
receive a novice, and this novice enters
their assembly for the first time, he sees a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>41</span>
toad of enormous size—as large, in fact,
as a goose. Some kiss its mouth, others
its rear. Then the novice meets a pale
man, with very black eyes, and so thin as
to appear only skin and bones; he kisses
this creature, too, and feels a chill as cold
as ice. After this kiss it is easy to forget
the Catholic faith. The sorcerers then
assemble at a banquet, during which a
black cat descends from behind a statue
that is usually placed in the center of the
gathering. The novice kisses the rear
anatomy of this cat, after which he salutes,
in a similar manner, those who preside at
the feast and others worthy of the honor.
The apprentice in sorcery receives in return
only the kiss of the master; after this
the lights are extinguished and all manner
of impure acts are committed among the
assemblage.“<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>This was the belief, then, of those who
a few years later composed the “<i>Tribunal
of the Inquisition</i>” and accepted the banner
of Loyola, and shortly afterwards again a
member of the congregation of Saint Dominick
and professor of theology, Barthelemi
de Lepine, convinced of the existence of
demons and Demonidolators, showed himself
to be a furious adversary of the sorcerers
in a famous dissertation, which was
immediately adopted by his co-religionists.
He affirmed that “the <i>possessed</i> go to the
<i>sorcerers’</i> meetings in body or in spirit and
have carnal intercourse with the devil;
that they immolate children, transforming
them into animals notably cats; that they
have obscene visions, and it is best to exterminate
them, for their number is growing legion.”</p>

<p>Barthelemi de Lepine, in speaking thus,
only followed the traditions of the Fathers
of the Church; of Saint George, Saint Eparchius,
Saint Bernard, Innocent VIII., and
of Antonio Torquemada, who were the
historians of the <i>incubi</i> of their times, and
launched anathemas against the <i>possessed</i> of
the Demon of luxury.</p>

<p>The Jesuit father Costadau wrote, in
his treatise <i>De Signis</i>, <i>apropos</i> of incubism:
“The thing is too singular to treat lightly.
We would not believe it ourselves had we
not been convinced by personal experience
with the Demon’s malice, and, on the other
hand, find an infinity of writings of the
first order from Popes, theologians, and
philosophers, who have sustained and
proved that there are men so unfortunate
as to have shameful commerce and other
things more execrable with such demons.”</p>

<p>Another Jesuit, Martin Antoine del
Rio, published six books (<i>Disquisitiones
Magicæ</i>) in 1599, in which his credulity
attained the limit of fanaticism, thus making
the good priest one of the most redoubtable
enemies of demonomania. Such
were the doctrines on which reposed the
theocratical pretensions of the theologians.</p>

<p>It is not astonishing that the last years
of the Middle Ages, during the time religious
struggles reached their highest
period of exacerbation, owing to the quarrels
between the Court of Rome and the
Reformation, witnessed the multiplication
in the number of demonomaniacs to such
an extent that the whole world commenced
to believe in the power of demons. “At
this unfortunate time,” remarks Esquirol,
“the excommunicated, the sorcerers and
the damned were seen everywhere; alarmed,
the Church created tribunals, before
which the devil was summoned to appear
and the <i>possessed</i> were brought to judgment;
scaffolds were erected, funeral pyres were
lighted around stakes, and demonomaniacs,
under the names of sorcerers and possessed,
doubly the victims of prevailing errors,
were burnt alive, after being tortured
to make them renounce pretended compacts
made with the Evil One. There was
a jurisprudence against sorcery and magic
as there were laws against theft and murder.
The people, seeing the Church and
Princes believing in the reality of these extravagances,
were positively persuaded as
to the existence of demons.”</p>

<p>No authority raised itself to protect
these miserable possessed people; justice,
philosophy, and science remained subjected
to theology, becoming more and
more the accomplices of an autocratic and
ever-intolerant Church.</p>

<p>Among the magistrates, historians and
publicists, who were the most ardent supporters
of the Inquisition, we may mention
J. Bodin, of Angers, who published, in
1581, a work entitled <i>Demonomanie</i>. He
shows that the victims of demonomania
enjoy perfect integrity of the mental faculties
and are in every sense responsible,
before Courts of Ecclesiastical Justice and
Parliaments, for their impure relations with
supernatural beings, and he logically concludes
that all Demonomaniacs should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>42</span>
committed to the stakes and burnt alive.
“Meantime,” says this amiable author,
“we can deliver the possessed by exorcisms,
and animals may be thus exorcised
as well as men.” To the support of his
thesis he then brings an immense collection
of ridiculous stories, which are not supported
by evidence. He says: “Those
possessed by a demon can spit rags, hair,
wood and nails from their mouths.” He
cites the case of a possessed woman who
had her chin turned towards her back,
tongue pushed out of the mouth, a throat
which furnished sounds analogous to the
crowing of a crow, the chatter of a magpie
and the song of the cuckoo. Finally,
he pretends that the devil may speak
through the mouth of the possessed and
use all the idioms, known and unknown;
that he can deflower young girls and give
them voluptuous sensations, etc.</p>

<p>This work of J. Bodin is, in reality,
the argument of a public prosecutor, presented
with passion and prejudice, having
all the erroneous arguments of the Inquisitors,
so that the latter were more than
satisfied at convincing the secular magistrates
and fixing their jurisdiction as to the
crime of sorcery. On the other hand, the
same year that Bodin gave publicity to his
inhuman side of the question, the <i>Essays
of Michel Montaigne</i> appeared in Paris, in
which this celebrated writer appealed to
philosophy. He demanded that human
life should be protected from fantastic
accusations, and made that famous response
to a Prince who showed him some
sorcerers condemned to death: “In faith,
I would rather prescribe hellebore than
hemlock faggots, as they appear to be
more insane than culpable.” Montaigne
concluded one of his essays on this subject
with the satirical remark: “It is placing a
high valuation on human conjecture when
we cook a man alive for an opinion.”</p>

<p>Meantime, Bodin had reasoned against
Montaigne. But the one remained the
ignorant prosecutor of the Middle Ages,
while the other was an immortal philosopher,
whom Colbert certainly quoted before
presenting to Louis XIV. the famous
edict of 1682, which forbade in the future
“<i>the cooking alive of sorcerers</i>.”</p>

<p>Meantime, there was still a century to
attain before one of the Prime Ministers of
France put an end to all trials for sorcery,
and during the intervening period there
were other purveyors of the death penalty
by the stake-burners of the Inquisition;
among these were the celebrated Boguet,
Criminal Judge of Bourgogne, and Pierre
de l’Ancre, his colleague of Aquitanus,
cited by Calmeil as the most fanatical
judges of their day.</p>

<p>Boguet, in his <i>Discours des Sorciers</i>,
wrote: “There were in France only three
hundred thousand under King Charles
IX., and they have since increased more
than half as much again. The Germans
prevent their growth by burning at the
stake; the Swiss destroy whole villages at
one time; in Lorraine the stranger may
see thousands existing with but few executions.
It is difficult to understand why
France cannot purge itself of these creatures.
These sorcerers walk around by
thousands and multiply on earth like caterpillars
in our gardens. I wish I could enforce
punishment according to my ideas,
for the earth would soon be purged of
those possessed. For I fain would collect
them all in one mass and burn them alive
in a single bonfire.”</p>

<p>Pierre de l’Ancre, Councillor to the Parliament
of Bordeaux, published in 1613 his
<i>Tableau de l’inconstance des mauvais anges et
demons</i>, and in 1622 his <i>Incredulite et
mecreance du sortilege pleinement convaincue</i>.
In these two works the author treats all
questions regarding sorcery, and declares
that in his capacity of judge he believes it
a mistake to spare the life of any individual
accused of magic, as he considers
sorcerers <i>as the enemies of morality and
religion</i>, and accuses them of having found
means of “ravishing women even while
they laid in the embraces of their husbands,
thus forcing and violating the
sacred oaths of marriage, for the victims
are made adulterous even in the presence
of their husbands, who remain motionless
and dishonored without power to prevent;
the women mute, enshrouded in a forced
silence, invoking in vain the help of the
husband against the sorcerer’s attack, and
calling uselessly for aid; the husband
charmed and unable to offer resistance,
suffering his own dishonor with open eyes
and helpless arms.</p>

<p>“The sorcerers dance around the bed
in an indecent manner, like at a Bacchanalian
feast, accoupling adulterously in a
diabolical fashion, committing execrable
sodomies, blaspheming scandalously, taking
insidious carnal revenges, perpetrating all
manner of unnatural acts, brutalizing and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>43</span>
denaturalizing all physical functions, holding
frogs, vipers, and lizards, and other
deadly animal poisons in their hands,
making stinking smells, caressing with
lascivious amorousness, giving themselves
over to horrible and shameful orgies.”</p>

<p>Thus says the Prosecutor of the Council
of Bordeaux, but he fails to support his
statements by a single material fact, not
even one individual case being proven.
His trials show nothing but a few poor demented
women, who responded always in
the affirmative to the obscene and indecent
questions of the judges and prosecutors
<i>employed by the Most Holy Inquisition</i>.</p>

<p>A sad thing philosophy registers celebrated
names during this Age. We mention
only those of Rene Descartes, Blaise
Pascal, Nicholas Malebranche, Thomas
Hobbes, Francis Bacon, Leibnitz, and the
immortal Newton. Unfortunately these
great geniuses could not take part in the
struggle between the clerical party and
free thinkers. Honored as scholars, their
Governments never asked their advice on
questions claimed to be under the control
of religious orders. The clergy had all the
latitude they desired in writing the history
of demonology, and also the evidence
wrung from those accused of sorcery—vague
responses drawn out by fear, by torture,
by suggestion imposed in the obscurity
of a penitential tabernacle. A witness
of veracity, as we have before stated,
never gave testimony as to the conduct of
the sorcerers at the secret vigils. Their
invocations on initiation, their famous inunctions
used on the body, with magical
ointments while in a condition of absolute
nudity; their equestrian position on broom
sticks; their flying tricks up the chimney
and their bewitched reunions when horned
devils rode on their shoulders, are legendary
recitals which could only be accepted
by ignorant fanatics and judges firm in the
Faith. How a man with the seeming
intelligence of Prosecutor Bodin, who was
delegated by the State, who wrote six
works on <i>The Republic</i> and <i>The Constitution</i>—works
which have been compared in
point of ability as ranking with Montesquieu’s
<i>Spirit of the Law</i>; how a publicist
of talent could support such stories as we
have mentioned in his work on sorcery is a
matter of profound amazement. Yet,
Bodin testifies as to his faith in the story of
that peasant of Touraine “who found
himself naked, wandering around the fields
in the morning,” and who gave as an explanation
of his conduct that he had surprised
his wife the night before as she was
making preparations to go to a sorcerers’
vigil, and that he had followed his better
half, accompanied by the Devil, as far as
Bordeaux, many leagues away. Bodin
also believed the narration of that girl from
Lyons “whom the lover perceived rubbing
herself with magical ointment preparatory
to attending a sorcerers’ vigil; and the
lover, using the same ointment, followed
his girl and arrived at the vigil almost as
soon as she.”</p>

<p>As to that poor peasant who was found
naked and alone in the field and forced to
denounce his wife to the authorities, Bodin
remarks impressively, “The woman confessed
and was condemned to be burnt at
the stake.”</p>

<p>Pierre de l’Ancre was never able to
prove his stories by sentinels, sergeants,
guards, or policemen, as to the appearance
of the demon he described in his
<i>Traite sur les demons</i>; a spirit that showed
itself as a large blood-hound or as a wild
bull. It is true that in another part of his
book he demonstrates the changeable character
of his Devil, and gives the following
description, which methinks is more worthy
the pen of an insane man rather than that
of a magistrate: “The Devil of the <i>sabbat</i>
(vigil) is seated in a black chair, with a
crown of black thorns, two horns at the
side of the head and one in the forehead
with which he gores the assemblage. The
Devil has bristling hair, pale and troubled
looking face, large round eyes widely
opened, inflamed and hideous looking, a
goatee, a crooked neck, the body of a man
combined with that of a billy goat, hands
like those of a human being, except that
the nails are crooked and sharp pointed at
the ends; the hands are curved backwards.
The Devil has a tail like that of a jackass,
with which, strange to say, he modestly
covers his private parts. He has a frightful
voice without melody; he preserves a
strange and superb gravity, having the
countenance of a person who is very
melancholy and tired out from overwork.”</p>

<p>This was the spirit of the lieutenants of
justice called on by the Inquisitorial clergy
to fix the penalty for the crime of sorcery.
“Sorcery being a crime,” say they with
the spirit of conviction, “consented to between
man and the Devil; the man bowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>44</span>
to adore Satan, and receiving in exchange
a part of his infernal power.”</p>

<p>According to this compact, “The demon
unites carnally with the sorcerer and
female medium likewise; these unite themselves
with Satan, denying God, Christ and
the Virgin, and profaning all objects of
sanctity by their profane presence.</p>

<p>“They become zealots for evil and
render eternal homage to the Prince of
Darkness.</p>

<p>“They are baptized by the Devil and
dedicate to his service all children born to
them by nature.</p>

<p>“They commit incests, poison people,
and bewitch and work cattle to death.</p>

<p>“They eat the carrion from the rotting
bodies of hanged criminals.</p>

<p>“They enter into a Cabalistic circle
laid out by the accursed one, and matriculate
in a secret order which is engaged in
all manner of outrages against society;
they accept secret marks that affirm their
complete vassalage to Satan.</p>

<p>“Finally, they repudiate all authority
other than that of the master in the Cabala
(Kabbala), and, abomination above all,
<i>they incite the people to revolt</i>.”</p>

<p>Meantime, while the Judges and Inquisitors
pursued all intelligent people with
the most wicked determination, Leloyer
published his monograph on specters,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
whose doctrines are closely connected with
modern Spiritualistic theories.</p>

<p>This celebrated Councillor wrote that
the soul, the spiritual essence which animates
the organism, may be distracted and
separated from the body for an instant, as
we see in cases of ecstacy.</p>

<p>Now, we know that this nervous phenomenon,
which may be <i>natural</i>, when
connected with catalepsy, hysteria and
somnambulism, or <i>provoked</i> when it is produced
experimentally on subjects in a hypnotic
condition, almost always coincides
with an acute moral impression and a suspension
of one or more of the senses. It
is during the duration of this phenomenon
that the soul, according to Leloyer, performs
far-off journeys,—not orthodox, however,
for we are told that during the period of
such ecstacies, following cataleptic immobility,
seven of these ecstatics were burned
alive at Nantes in 1549.</p>

<p>In another chapter, he adds that souls
may, after death, impress themselves on
our senses by taking fantastic forms. He
supports this opinion by the incident relative
to a daughter of the famous Juriscouncillor
of the sixteenth century, Charles
Dumoulin, who appeared to her husband
and told him the names of assassins; and
of the specter who informed the Justice of
the crime committed by the woman Sornin
on her husband, that the soul of Commodus
appeared so often to Caracalla.</p>

<p>The author of the <i>Spectres</i> attributes to
supernatural beings the frights experienced
by certain persons who live in haunted
houses. Every night they are awakened
by the sound of noises,—blows resound on
the floor and raps come on the partitions;
every few minutes there are peals of ghostly
laughter, whistling, clapping of hands to
attract attention; these nervous persons
see spirits and are startled at sudden apparitions
of the dead; specters seize them by
the feet, nose, ears, and even go so far as
sit on their chests. Such houses are said
to be the rendezvous of demons.</p>

<p>The persons spoken of by Leloyer <i>are
to-day known as mediums producing physical
effects</i>, and the phenomena observed centuries
since are evidently the same as
those investigated by William Crookes,
with the collaboration of Kate Fox and
Home.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>“In the ecstacy of sorcerers,” resumes
Leloyer, “the soul is present, but is so
preoccupied by the impressions that it receives
from the Devil, that it cannot act on
the body it animates. On awaking, such
ecstatics may remember things they have
seen, events in which they have assisted, as
in the case when the soul temporarily
abandons its earthly tenement.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is but fair to observe
that the author makes certain reservations;
he admits that ecstacy and hallucination
may be provoked by a pathological condition
of the nervous system, and are not
always the result of the work of demons.
He also comments on a certain number of
vampires remaining in a lethargic sleep,
from a nervous condition, after returning
from a sorcerer’s vigil, a fact which,
according to Calmeil, was of a nature to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>45</span>
throw the theories of the Councillors of the
Inquisition into disfavor.</p>

<p>The theory of the author of <i>Spectres</i>
resembles considerably, as will at once be
noticed, that of the first Magii and the
modern doctrine of Spiritualism. Leloyer,
besides, has gathered a number of facts to
support his affirmations; among others, he
cites the observation given him by Philip
de Melanchton, the learned Hellenist and
author of the famous confession of Augsburg.
This was a spiritual manifestation
experienced by the widow of Melanchton’s
uncle: One day, while weeping and thinking
of the dear lost one, two spirits appeared
to her suddenly,—“one habited in
the stately, dignified form of her husband,
the other specter in the garb of a gray
friar. The one representing her husband
approached her and said a few consoling
words, touched her hand and disappeared
with his monkish companion.”</p>

<p>Melanchton, although one of the chiefs
of the Reformation, was still imbued with
the ideas of the Romish Church; after
some hesitation he concluded that the
specters seen by his aunt were demons.
The same phenomena have been observed
by modern <i>mediums</i>; William Crookes,
the celebrated London scientist, relates
facts to which he has been witness which
are even more extraordinary than the one
we have just narrated.</p>

<p>Jerome Cardan, of Paris, the celebrated
mathematician, renowned for his discovery
of the formula for resolving cubic equations,
solemnly affirmed that he had a protecting
spirit, and never doubted the reality
of this apparition. Cardan also tells how
his father one evening received a visit from
seven specters, who did not fear to enter
into an argument with the learned old
man.</p>

<p>Imagination, exalted by chimerical fear
of demons, sees the work of these evil-doing
spirits on every hand, in gambling,
in sickness, in accidents, in infirmity, in
all the ordinary accidents of life. The
sorcerers are accused of attacking man’s
virility by witchcraft. The victims say
that some one has knotted their private
organs (<i>noue l’aiguilette</i>). This pretended
catastrophe in magic, the origin of which
dates back to times of antiquity, may be
classed among abnormal physiological
effects under the influence of a moral
cause, fear, timidity, and certainly the
suggestion of a feeble mind.</p>

<p>Such are the sorcerers that Bodin accuses,
perhaps not without reason always,
since we see that impotency in some
young melancholic subjects who appear
easily impressed with fantastic notions.</p>

<p>“Sorcerers,” says Bodin, “have the
power to remove but a single organ from
the body, that is, the virile organ; this
thing they often do in Germany, often
hiding a man’s privates in his belly, and in
this connection Spranger tells of a man at
Spire who thought he had lost his privates
and visited all the physicians and surgeons
in the neighborhood, who could find nothing
where the virile organs had once been,
neither wound nor scar; but the victim
having made peace with the sorcerer, to
his great joy soon had his treasure restored.”</p>

<p>There was no need of this kind of
witchcraft, <i>pour nouer l’aiguilette</i>, in a timid
boy, already subjugated by fear of the
devil. Certainly, if the sorcerers had ideas
of that force which is known to-day as <i>suggestion</i>,
they could very easily destroy the
virile power of the subject by governing
his will and thoughts, his physical and
moral personality. When we can confiscate
the physical anatomy of a man he is
reduced to all manner of impotencies.
Who will affirm that suggestion is not one
of the mysteries of sorcery?</p>


<h3>DEMONOLOGICAL PHYSICIANS.</h3>

<p>After the theosophists, theurgists, and
the priests, we will now interrogate the
writings of the physicians of antiquity and
of the Middle Ages, as to this question of
spirits and their connection with the affairs
of mankind.</p>

<p>We see that Galen is often drawn away
by the beliefs of his time, to the most
ridiculous prejudices and fancies, and that
he is the defender of magical conjurations.
He claimed that Æsculapius appeared to
him one day in a dream and advised bleeding
in the treatment of pleurisy by which
he was attacked.</p>

<p>After Galen, Soranus of Ephesus used
magical chants for curing certain affections.
Scribonius Largus, a contemporary
of the Emperor Claudius, indicated the
manner of gathering plants, so that they
might possess the strongest healing properties
(the left hand must be raised to the
Moon). Plants thus gathered cured even
serpent bites. Archigenes suspended amulets
on the necks of his patients. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>46</span>
although Pliny often declared that he wished
“to examine everything in nature and not
to speculate on occult causes” he reproduces
in his works all the superstitious
practices employed in medicine.</p>

<p>In the sixth century, Ætius, physician
to the Court of Constantinople, acquired
great surgical renown by the preparation
of applications of pomades, ointments, and
other topical remedies, in which superstition
played a leading <i>role</i>.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Thus, in
making a certain salve it was necessary to
repeat several times in a low voice, “May
the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
accord efficacy to this medicine.” If one
had a foreign body in the throat it was
necessary to touch the neck of the patient
and say, “As Jesus Christ raised Lazarus,
and Jonah came out of a whale, come
out thou bone”; or, better still, “The
Martyr Blase and the Servant of Christ
commands thee to come out of the throat
or descend to the stomach.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>After Ætius, we see Alexander of
Tralles indulge in the same follies. In the
colic he bids us use a stone on which is
represented Hercules seated on a lion,
a ring of iron on which was inscribed
a Greek sentence, and, on the other, the
diagram of the Gnostics (a figure composed
of two equilateral triangles); and he adds
that sacred things must not be profaned.</p>

<p>Against the gout, the same Alexander
of Tralles recommended a verse from
Homer, or, better still, to engrave on a
leaf of gold the words <i>mei</i>, <i>dreu</i>, <i>mor</i>, <i>phor</i>,
<i>teus</i>, <i>za</i>, <i>zown</i>. He conjured, by the words
<i>Iao</i>, <i>Sabaoth</i>, <i>Adonai</i>, <i>Eloi</i>, a plant he employed
in the same disease. In quotidian
fever he advised an amulet made of an
olive leaf on which was written in ink, <i>Ka
Poi. A.</i><a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>In the thirteenth century, Hugo de
Lucques said a <i>Pater noster</i> and other
prayers to the Trinity to cure fractures of
the limbs. But in the following century
astrology replaced the magic of religious
superstition. Arnauld de Villeneuve attributed
to each hour of the day a particular
virtue which influenced, according to
the influence of the horoscope, the different
parts of the body. According to Arnauld,
we can use bleeding only on
certain days when such and such a constellation
is in place, and no other time; but the
position of the moon more particularly
needed attention. The most favorable
time for phlebotomy was when Luna was
found in the sign of Cancer; but the conjunction
of the latter with Saturn is injurious
to the effects of medicines, and
especially of purgatives.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>His contemporary, Bernard de Gordon
(of Montpellier), gives as a sure method of
hastening difficult accouchments the reading
of passages from the Psalms of David.
He explains the humors of certain hours of
the day in the following manner: the
blood in the morning moves towards the
sun, with which it is in harmony; but it
falls towards evening, because the greatest
amount of sanguification occurs during
sleep. In the third hour of the day the
bile runs downwards, to the end that it
may not make the blood acid;<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> the black
bile moves at the ninth hour and the
mucus towards evening.</p>

<p>The efficacy of precious stones for bewitching,
and many other superstitious
ideas, were likewise noted by medical
authors, notably Italian writers, as, for instance,
Michel Savonarola, Professor at
Ferrara, one of the most celebrated physicians
of his age. In Germany, Agrippa of
Nettesheim, philosopher, alchemist and
physician, had a predilection for magic
and the occult sciences, if we are to judge
from his works published in 1530 and
1531, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>De incertitudianæ et vanitate scientiarum</i>,
<i>De occulta philosophia</i>, in which he
mentions action induced at a distance and
forsees the discovery of magnetism.</p>

<p>Like him, his contemporaries, Raymond
Lulle, in Spain, and J. Reuchlin,
published books on the Cabala (<i>Kabbala</i>),
and, in Italy, Porta founded, at Naples,
the <i>Academy of Secrets</i>, for the development
of occult sciences, which are explained in
his treatise <i>De Magia Naturali</i>.</p>

<p>At almost the same epoch, Paracelsus,
Professor at Basle, claimed that he possessed
the universal panacea; that he had
found the secret of prolonging life, by
magic and astrology, for he diagnosed diseases
through the influence of the stars.
After him, Van Helmont defended animal
magnetism, and gave himself up to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>47</span>
study of occult science, in company with
his student, Rodolphe Goclenius.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, Fernel, who,
inasmuch as he was a mathematician and
an astronomer, published his <i>Cosmotheria</i>,
where he indicated the means of measuring
a meridian degree with exactitude;
his remarkable works on physiology (<i>De
naturali parte medicinæ</i>, 1542), on pathology
and therapeutics, which gave him the
nickname of the French Galen. Fernel
fully admitted the action of evil spirits on
the body of man; he believed that adorers
of the Demons could, by the aid of imprecations,
enchantments, invocations and
talismans, draw fallen angels into the
bodies of their enemies, and that these Demons
could then cause serious sickness.
He compared the <i>possessed</i> to maniacs, but
that the former had the gift of reading the
past and divining the most secret matters.
He affirmed that he had been witness of a
case of delirium caused by the presence of
the Devil in a patient, that which was denied
by several doctors at the epoch.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
He also believed in lycanthropy....
In the same century, another of our medical
glories, Ambroise Pare, the Father of
French surgery, also adopted the theory of
the Inquisitors regarding sorcery in his
works,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> in which may be found his remarkable
anatomical and surgical discoveries.
We read the following quaintly
conceived passage: “Demons can suddenly
change themselves into any form
they wish; one often sees them transformed
into serpents, frogs, bats, crows,
goats, mules, dogs, cats, wolves, and bulls;
they can be transmuted into men as well
as into angels of light; they howl in the
night and make infernal noises as though
dragging chains, <i>they move chairs and tables</i>,
rock cradles, turn the leaves of books,
count money, throw down buckets, etc.,
etc. They are known by many names,
such as cacodemons, incubi, succubi, coquemares,
witches, hobgoblins, goblins, bad
angels, Satan, Lucifer, etc.</p>

<p>“The actions of Satan are supernatural
and incomprehensible, passing human
understanding, and we can no more understand
them than we can comprehend why
the loadstone attracts the needle. Those
who are possessed by demons can speak
with the tongue drawn out of their mouth,
through the belly and by other natural
parts; they speak unknown languages,
cause earthquakes, make thunder, clear up
the weather, drag up trees by the roots,
move a mountain from one place to
another, raise castles in the air and put
them back in their places without injury,
and can fascinate and dazzle the human
eye.</p>

<p>“<i>Incubi</i> are demons in the disguise of
men, who copulate with female sorcerers;
<i>succubi</i> are demons disguised as women,
who practice vile habits not only on sleeping,
but wakeful men.”</p>

<p>“Ambroise Pare,” says Calmeil, “believed
that demons <i>hoarded up all kinds of
foreign bodies in their victims’ persons</i>, such as
old netting, bones, horse-shoes, nails, horsehair,
pieces of wood, serpents, and other
curious odds and ends, and cites the wellknown
case of Ulrich Neussersser.”</p>

<p>The celebrated surgeon concludes from
this that “it was the Devil who made the
iron blades and other articles found in the
stomach and intestines of the unfortunate
Ulrich.”</p>

<p>What would Pare have thought had he
seen the strange objects so commonly
found by modern surgeons in ovarian
cysts? How many demons would it take
to produce the numerous objects noticed at
the present day?</p>

<p>Happily these demonological physicians
accepted purely and simply the suggestion
that demons could act on men, and
abandoned the victims to the tender mercy
of the theologians and their tools the
lawyers. Yet, even in this time of atrocities
there were a few courageous physicians
who struggled for humanity as against
ecclesiastical despotism. Let us quote,
according to Calmeil, one Francoise Ponzinibus,
who destroyed one by one all the
arguments that served to support the
criminal code against demons. It was this
brave doctor who dared to write that
demonidolatry constituted a true disease;
that all the sensations leading the ignorant
to believe in <i>spirits</i> who adored the Devil
were due to a depraved moral and physical
condition; that it was false that certain
persons could isolate their souls from their
bodies at night and thus leave their homes
for far off places inhabited by demons;
that the accouplement of sorcerers and all
the crimes attributed to them could not be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>48</span>
logically supposed but must be legally
proven; that it was cruel and atrocious to
burn demented people at the stake for
witchcraft.</p>

<p>Let us also quote from Andre Alciat,
another courageous physician, who dared
accuse an Inquisitor of murdering a multitude
of insane people on the plea of witchcraft.
He considered the vigil (<i>sabbat</i>) of
sorcerers as an absurd fiction, and saw in
so-called <i>possessed</i> only so many poor demented
women given over to fanatical
delusions and wild dreams.</p>

<p>Paul Zacchias, the author of “Medico-Legal
Questions” (<i>Questiones Medico-legales</i>),
a work in which he shows himself
to be as wise an alienist as Doctor of
Laws. The avowed and open enemy
of supernaturalism, he boldly denounced
the cruelties committed against the demented.</p>

<p>Let us finally inscribe on the roll of
honor, with our respects, the name of Jean
Wier,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> or rather of Joannes Wierus, physician
to the Duke of Cleves, who studied
in Paris, where he received the degree of
doctor, and was afterwards the disciple of
Cornelius Agrippa, a partisan of demonology.
Like the latter, Jean Weir believed
in astrology, alchemy, the cabala, sorcerers
and female mediums; likewise in demons
who possessed control of human beings
through magic power. But in his works
that he published in 1560 he proclaims the
innocence of those unfortunates punished
for witchcraft, and declares them to have
been insane and melancholic; likewise
asserting that they could have been cured
by proper treatment. He declares that he
is fully persuaded that sorcerers, witches,
and lycanthropic patients who were burned
at the stake were crazy people whose
reason had been overthrown; and that the
faults imputed to these unfortunates were
dangerous to none but themselves; that
the possessed were dupes to false sensations
that had been experienced during the
time of their ecstatic transports or in their
sleep.</p>

<p>Weir<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> insisted that the homicidal
monomania attributed to the inhabitants of
Vaud should not be credited, and was
not except by fools and fanatics; while the
so-called vampires, whose blood was shed
on the banks of Lake Leman, the borders
of the Rhine, and on the mountains of
Savoy, had never been guilty of crimes,
nor murders especially, and cites cases of
condemnation where the <i>insanity</i> or <i>imbecility</i>
of the victims was incontestible. He
declares, in general, that all sorcerers are
irresponsible, that they are insane, and
that the devils possessing them can be
combatted without exorcism. “Above
all,” says he to the judges and executioners,
“do not kill, do not torture. Have
you fear that these poor frightened women
have not suffered enough already? Think
you they can have more misery than that
they already suffer? Ah! my friends, even
though they merited punishment, rest
assured of one thing, <i>that their disease is
enough</i>.” Beautiful words, worthy of a
grand philosopher. Born in the sixteenth
century, he believed in magic and sorcery;
but as a physician he pleaded for the
saving of human life, and as a man he
frowned down the crimes committed on
the scaffold. “The duty of the monk,”
says he, “is to study how to cure the soul
rather than to destroy it.” Alas! he
preached his doctrine in the barren desert
of ecclesiastical fanaticism.</p>

<p>Although, less well known than those
names just mentioned, we must not forget
to note that group of talented men who
contributed with Ponzinibus, Alciat, Zacchias
and Jean Wier in the restoration to
medicine of the study of facts, thus freeing
the healing art of many speculative ideas
derived from the Middle Ages; we allude
to such men as Baillou, Francois de la Boe
(<i>Sylvius</i>), Felix Plater, Sennert, Willis,
Bonet, and many other gallant souls who
assisted in freeing medicine from the religious
autocracy that overshadowed it,—men
who were the <i>avant couriers</i> of modern
positivism.</p>

<p>Many of those who had preceded these
writers had been learned men and remarkable
physicians, to whom anatomy, clinical
medicine and surgery owed important discoveries,
but the majority of these were
not brave enough to defend their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>49</span>
intelligence against religious superstitions. In
some instances, indeed, they were even
the criminal accessories of the theologians
and inquisitors. In acting in adhesion to
Demonological ideas, their very silence on
grand psychological questions evidences
their weakness,—we are sorry to say this,—and
lowers them from the high position
of humanitarians; the masses of the people
of the Middle Ages owed the majority of
their medical savants nothing on the score
of liberty of conscience.</p>


<h3>THE BEWITCHED, POSSESSED, SORCERERS
AND DEMONOMANIACS.</h3>

<p>In order to fully comprehend the
Demonomania of the Middle Ages, it is
necessary to previously analyze the different
elements composing the medical constitution
of the epoch, and, investigate under what
morbid influences such strange <i>neuroses</i>
were produced.</p>

<p>These influences, we shall find from
thence, in the state of intellectual and
moral depression provoked by the successive
pestilential epidemics, which, from
the sixth century decimated the population
of Western Europe; in the disposition of
the human mind towards supernaturalism,
which had invaded all classes of society;
in the terrors excited by the tortures of an
ever flaming and eternal hell; in the fright,
caused by the cruel and atrocious decisions
of brutal Inquisitors, and their fanatical
tools, the officers of the law. We find too,
that a frightful condition of misery had
weakened the inhabitants of city and
country, morally and physically, inducing
a multitude of women to openly enter into
prostitution for protection and nutrition,
owing to the iniquity of a despotic regime;
then too, there were added bad conditions
of hygiene and moral decadence, so that intelligence
was sapped and undermined,
together with a breaking down of the
vitality of the organism.</p>

<p>In the recital of the miseries of the
Middle Age, made by a master hand, by
an illustrious historian, who bases his
assertions on antique chronicles whose
veracity cannot be questioned, we read the
following: “Society was impressed with a
profound sentiment of sadness, it was as
though a pall of grief covered the generation;
the whole world given over to
plagues; the invasion by barbarians; horrible
diseases; terrible famines decimating
the masses by starvation; violent wind
storms; greyish skies with foggy days;
the darkness of night casting its shroud
everywhere; a cry of lamentation ascends
to Heaven through all this gruesome
period. That sombre witness, our contemporary
Glaber, fully indicates the
position of society devoured by war,
famine and the plague. It was thought
that the order of seasons and the laws of
the elements, that up to that period
governed the world, had fallen back
into the original chaos. It was thought
that the end of the human race had
arrived.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>When the epidemic of Demonomania
attacked the earth, at the end of the
fifteenth century, more than ten generations
had undergone the depressive action
of the superstitions and false ideas
spread broadcast by religion. Heredity
had prepared the earth, the human mind
being in an absolute condition of receptivity
for all pathological actions. The
education of children was confined to
teaching them foolish doctrines, diabolical
legends, mysterious practices that weakened
their judgments. With the progression,
from childhood to majority, a vague sentiment
of uneasiness was experienced with a
constant preoccupation on the subject of conscience
and sin. In full adult age, as we
have observed, came religious monomania,
with acute sexual excitement, and persistent
erotic ideas.</p>

<p>Arriving at this phase of the situation,
some became theomaniacs, others demonomaniacs,
saying they were possessed by
sorcery, under the influence of genesic
and other senses, with psychal hallucinations,
and in some cases, psycho-sensorial
illusions. These fictitious perception
were produced either through the influence
of the mind, assailed by supernatural
conceptions, or by morbid impressions
transmitted most often by the great
sympathetic, or, finally, by an unknown
action arising from the exterior.</p>

<p>Under the influence of these hallucinations,
which manifested themselves in a
state of somnambulism, or during physiological
sleep, the recollection persisting to
the after awakening, the Demonomaniac
responded to those asking questions, that
he had heard the confused noises made by
the sorcerers at their <i>vigil</i>, had heard also
the conversation of the devils, and had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>50</span>
seen scenes of the wildest prostitution
enacted by the demons; that fantastic
animals were perceived; that strange odors
of a diabolical nature, the savor of rotten
meat, and corrupt human flesh, tainted
blood of new born babes, and other
noisome things had been smelled; that
these effluvias were horrible, repulsive,
nauseating, combined with the stink of
sorcerers and the sulphurous vapors of
magical perfumes; that he felt himself
touched by supernatural beings who had
the lightness of smoke or mist, and wafted
away in the air. The hallucinations of
the genital senses had led him to believe
he had carnal connection, always of a
painful nature, with succubi. When the
victim to these delusions was a woman,
she had the impression of having been
brutally violated or deflowered, and some
women declared they oftentimes experienced
the voluptuous sensations of an
amorous coition.</p>

<p>These hallucinations developed one
after the other; those belonging to the
anesthetized class, coming first, those
belonging to the genesic class, coming
last. The complexity of their symptoms
produced what we call <i>dedoublement</i>, or a
dual personality. Those <i>possessed</i>, claimed
to be in the power of a demon, who
entered their body by one of the natural
passages, sporting with their person,
placing itself in apposition with any place
in their organism, proposing all sorts of
erotic acts, natural and unnatural, whispering
shameless propositions in their ears,
blasphemy against God, forcing them to
sign a contract with the Devil in their own
blood.</p>

<p>The nervous state in which such weak
minded creatures were found, victims to
nocturnal hallucinations, insensibly induced
a species of permanent somnambulism,
during which they acquired a particularly
morbid personality. They affirmed themselves
to be sorcerers possessed by demons.
When this personality disappeared, and the
patient returned to a normal condition,
a simple suggestion was all sufficient to
cause the reappearance of the hallucination.
This explains why so many individuals
accused of sorcery, denied at first what
they afterwards affirmed. When the Judge
demanded with an air of authority, what
they had done at the witch meeting, (<i>vigil</i>),
they entered into a most precise recital of
minute details, and all the circumstances
surrounding the nocturnal reunions of
demons and their victims; and, by reason
of this crazy avowal, or so called confession
were burned at the stake for participation
in diabolical practices.</p>

<p>In the <i>Chronicles of Enguarrand, of Monstrelet</i>,
a truthful and trustworthy historian
of the incidents of his time, we find a
description of the famous <i>epidemics</i> of
sorcery in Artois, which caused such a multitude
of victims to be burnt at the stake, by
order of the Inquisition. The facts recounted
by this celebrated writer support
the interpretations we have given to these
phenomena. He expresses himself as
follows:</p>

<p>“In 1459, in the village of Arras, in
the country of Artois, came a terrible and
pitiable case of what we named <i>Vaudoisie</i>.
I know not why.” “Those possessed, who
were men and women, said that they were
carried off every night by the Devil, from
places where they resided, and suddenly
found themselves in other places, in woods
or deserts, when they met a great number
of other men and women, who consorted
with a large Devil in the disguise of a man,
who never showed his face. And this
Demon read, and prescribed laws and
commandments for them, which they were
obliged to obey; then made his assembled
guests kiss his buttocks; after which, he
presented each adept a little money, and
feasted them on wines and rich foods,
after which the lights were suddenly
extinguished, and strange men and women
knew each other carnally in the darkness,
after which they were suddenly wafted
through space, back to their own habitations,
and awakened as if from a dream.</p>

<p>“This hallucination was experienced
by several notable persons of the city of
Arras, and other places, men and women,
<i>who were so terribly tormented, that they
confessed</i>, and in confessing, acknowledged
that they had seen at these witch reunions
many prominent persons, among others,
prelates, nobles, Governors of towns and
villages, <i>so that when the judges examined
them, they put the names of the accused
in the mouths of those who testified</i>, and they
persisted in such statements although
forced by pains and tortures to say that
they had seen otherwise, and the innocent
parties named were likewise put in prison,
and tortured so much, that confessions
were forced from them; and <i>these too,
were burned at the stake most inhumanely</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>51</span></p>

<p>“Some of those accused who were rich
and powerful escaped death by paying out
money; others were reduced into making
confessions on the promise that in <i>case they
confessed their lives and property would be
spared</i>. Some there were indeed who suffered
torments with marvelous patience,
not wishing to confess on account of creating
prejudice against themselves; many of
these gave the Judges large bribes in
money to relieve them from punishment.
Others fled from the country on the first
accusation, and afterwards proved their
perfect innocence.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Calmeil considers this narrative of so-called
sorcery as a delirium, prevailing
epidemically in Artois, where “many insane
persons were executed,” although he
is forced to add: “these facts lead us to
foresee what misfortunes pursued the false
disciples of Satan in former times.”</p>

<p>These neuroses of the inhabitants of
Artois had already been observed, almost
half a century previous, among a class of
sectarians by the name of the <i>Poor of Lyons</i>.
These people were designated in the
Romanesque tongue as <i>faicturiers</i>, the word
<i>faicturerie</i> meaning sorcerer, or one who
believes in magic. Demonomania then
evidently dated back to the very commencement
of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The judgment of the tribunals of Arras,
which condemned the sorcerers of Artois
to be burned alive at the stake, is a curious
document in old French, which merits a
short notice at least, for it is supported on
the following considerations, which were
accepted as veracious, although merely the
delirious conceptions of ignorant peasants:</p>

<p>“When one wished to go to the witch
reunion (<i>vigil</i>), it was only necessary to
take some magical ointment, rubbed on a
yard stick, and also a small portion rubbed
on the hands. This yard stick or broomstick
placed between the legs, permitted
one to fly where he willed over mountain
and dale, over sea and river, and carried
one to the Devil’s place of meeting, where
were to be found tables loaded down with
fine eatables and drinkables. There was
also the Devil himself, in the form of a
monkey, a dog or a man, as the case might
be, and to him one pledged obedience and
rendered homage; in fact one adored the
Devil and presented unto him his soul.
Then the possessed kissed the Devil’s
rear—kissing it goat fashion in a butting
attitude. After having eaten and taken
drink, all the assemblage assumed carnal
forms; even the Devil took the disguise of
man or sometimes woman. Then the multitude
committed the crime of sodomy and
other horrible and unnatural acts—sins
against God that were so wholly contrary to
nature that the aforesaid Inquisitor says he
does not even dare to name, they are too
terrible and wicked ever to mention to innocent
ears, crimes as brutal as they were
cruel.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Among these sorcerers there was a
poet, a painter and an old Abbot, who
passed for an amateur in the mysteries of
Isis. Perhaps the Inquisition pursued such
individuals as sorcerers and heretics,
knowing them to be given over to debauchery.
Similar things occurred as before
said very early in the Middle Ages.(<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>)</p>

<p>As also before mentioned, there were
demons who cohabited with women at
night, and sometimes with men, called
<i>incubi</i> and <i>succubi</i>, following as they were
active, (<i>incubare</i>, to lie upon), or passive,
(<i>sub cubare</i>, to lie under).</p>

<p>Calmeil has written, that virgins dedicated
to chastity by holy laws were
frequently visited by these demons, disguised
in the image of Christ, or of an
angel, or seraphim. Sometimes the
Devil took the form of the Holy Virgin,
and attempted to seduce young monks
from paths of piety. “Having impressed
the victims with the power of beauty,”
says the sage alienist,(<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>) “the wicked
demon then got into the bed of the young
girl, or young man, as the case might be,
and sought to seduce them through shameful
practices. The Gods, so say the ancients,
often sought the society of the daughters
of Princes; these pretended Gods were
nothing but demons. A Devil possessed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>52</span>
Rhea, under the form of Mars, and this
succubus passed for Venus the day Anchises
thought he cohabited with the Godess of
beauty.</p>

<p>“The demon incubi accosted by
preference fallen women, under the form
of a black man, or goat. From times
immemorial, damned spirits have attacked
certain females, under the form of lascivious
brutes. Hairy satyrs or shags, fauns and
sylvains were only disguised incubi.</p>

<p>The connections between the <i>possessed</i>
and <i>incubi</i> were often accompanied by a
painful sensation of compression in the
epigastric region, with impossibility of
making the least movement, the victim
could not speak or breathe. She had all
the phenomena noticeable in an attack of
nightmare. Meantime, some had different
sensations. A nun of Saint Ursula,
named Armella, said that she seemed
“always in company with demons who
tempted her to surrender her honor.
During five months, while this combat
lasted, it was impossible to sleep at night,
by reason of the specters, who assumed
varied and monstrous shapes.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> This
virtuous nun preserved her chastity notwithstanding
the frightful ordeal.</p>

<p>Angele de Foligno accused the incubi,
says Martin del Rio, of beating her without
pity, of putting fire in her generative
organs, and inspiring her with infernal
lubricity. There was no portion of her
body that was not bruised by the attack of
these demons, and the lady was not able
to rise from her bed.</p>

<p>Another nun, named Gertrude, cited
by Jean Wier, avowed that from the age
of fourteen years, she had slept with
Satan in person, and that the Devil had
made love to her, and often wrote her
letters full of the most tender and passionate
expressions. A letter was found in
this poor nun’s cell, on the 25th of March,
1565. This amorous epistle was full of
the details of the Demon’s nocturnal
debaucheries.</p>

<p>Bodin, in his “Demonomania” gives
the observation of Jeanne Hervillier, who
was burned alive, by sentence of the
Parliament of Paris. She confessed to her
Judges, that she had been presented to the
Devil, by her grandmother, at the age of
twelve years. “A Devil in the form of a
large black man, who dressed in a black
suit and rode a black horse. This Devil
had carnal intercourse with her, the same
as men have with women, only without
seed. This sin had been continued every
ten, or fifteen days, even after she married
and slept with her husband.”</p>

<p>This same author reports many instances
of the same kind. Among others,
that of Madelaine de la Croix, Abbess of
a nunnery in Spain, who went to Pope
Paul III., confessing, that from the age of
twelve years, she had relations with a
demon, <i>in the form of a Moor</i>, and, that for
more than thirty years this commerce had
been continued. Bodin firmly believes,
that this nun had been presented to Satan,
“<i>from the belly of her mother</i>,” and affirms
that “such copulations are neither illusions,
nor diseases.” In his work, he also gives
extracts of the interrogatories put to the
Sorcerers of Longni, in the presence of
Adrien de Fer, Lieutenant General of
Laon. These sorcerers were condemned
to be burnt at the stake, for having commerce
with incubi. He mentions Marguerite
Bremond, who avowed that she
had been led off one evening, by her own
mother, to a reunion of Demons, and
“found in this place six devils in human
shape, but hideous to behold. After the
demon dance was finished, the devils
returned to the couches with the girls, and
one cohabited with her for the space of
half an hour, but she escaped conception,
as he was seedless.”</p>

<p>One of the distinctive characters of
demons, was their infectious stink,
which exhaled from all portions of the
body. This odor attributed to the Devil
was an hallucination to the sense of smell
which entered, like those of the genesic
sense, into all the complex hallucinations
of Demonomania.</p>

<p>Examples of men cohabiting with
demons, are cited by many authors of the
Middle Ages. Gregory of Tours has left
us the record of Eparchius, Bishop of
Auvergne, who cohabited with succubi.</p>

<p>Jerome Cardan, physician and Italian
mathematician, tells of a priest who cohabited
for over fifty years, with a demon
disguised as a woman.</p>

<p>Pic de Mirandolle, relates how another
priest had commerce for over forty years
with a beautiful succubus, whom he called
Hermione. Bodin recounts the story of
Edeline, the Prior of a religious community<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>53</span>
in Sorbonne. An adversary of Demonomaniacal
doctrines, Edeline was accused
by the theologians of defending demons.
Before the Tribunal the Prior declared
that he had been visited by Satan, in the
form of a black ram, and had prostituted
his body to an incubus, and only obeyed
his master in preaching that sorcery was
a chimerical invention. “Although
the proof furnished by the registers of the
Tribunal of Poitiers,” remarks Calmeil,
“leaves no doubt as to the alienation of
the intellectual faculties at the moment of
his trial, Edeline was none the less condemned
to perpetual seclusion from the
world.”</p>

<p>As another striking example of hallucination,
bearing upon this question of incubism,
Guibert de Nogent tells of a monk,
“who was sick, and retained the services of
a Jew doctor. In exchange for health,
the aforesaid physician, demanded a
sacrifice. ‘What sacrifice?’ asked the
monk. ‘The sacrifice of that which is
the most precious to men,’ answered the
Jew. ‘What may that be?’ inquired the
monk. And the demon, for it was the
Devil disguised as a doctor, had the audacity
to explain. ‘Oh curses! Oh shame!
to require such a thing of a priest’—but
the victim, nevertheless, did what was
asked. It was the denial of Christ and the
true faith.”</p>

<p>Like psycho-sensorial hallucinations of
the other senses, that of the genesic sense
may assume the erotic type of disease, and
is due undoubtedly, in some men, to a repletion
of the spermatic vesicules. It is
this that Saint Andre, physician in ordinary
to Louis XIV., gives as an explanation of
incubism. “The incubus,”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> says this
writer, “a chimera that had for its foundation
only a dream, an over excited imagination,
too often a longing after women;
artifice had no less a part in the creation of
the incubus,—a woman, a girl, only a
devotee in name, already long before debauched,
but desiring to appear virtuous to
hide her crime, passes off the offenses of
some lover as the act of a demon; this is
the ordinary explanation. In this artifice
the woman is often aided by the <i>suggestions</i>
of the man—a man who has heard <i>succubi</i>
speaking to him in his sleep, usually sees
most beautiful women in his dreams,
which, under such circumstances, are often
erotic.”</p>

<p>It is certain that an ardent imagination
and exaggerated sexual appetite have
played a leading <i>role</i> in the history of
<i>incubi</i>, but, meantime, there may be exceptions.</p>

<p>Nicholas Remy, Inquisitor of Lorraine,
has given a description of <i>impurities</i> committed
between demons and sorcerers,
according to the testimony given by those
<i>possessed</i>.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Fortunately, he has only given
a Latin version of what they have told
him. He states: “<i>Hic igitur, sive vir incubet,
sive succubet fœmina, liberum in utroque
naturæ debet esse officium, nihilque omnino
intercedere quod id vel minimum moretur atque
impediat, si pudor, metus, horror, sensusque,
aliquis acrior ingruit; il icet ad irritum redeunt
omnia e lumbis affœaque prorsus sit
natura</i>.”</p>

<p>Then comes the sentence of the four
girls of Vosges, according to the confessions,
who were named Nanette, Claudine,
Nicola, and Didace, and of whom Nicholas
Remy, fortunately for the masses of the
profession, only speaks in Latin, lest modesty
be shocked at the narration. “<i>Alexia
Drigæa recensuit doémoni suo pœnem, cum
surrigebat tentum semper extitisse quanti essent
subices focarii, quos tum forte præsentes digito
demonstrabat; scroto ac coleis nullis inde pendentibus</i>,
etc.” (We forbear from further
quotation and for fuller particulars refer
the reader to the original.)</p>

<p>Were these girls attacked by a malady,
a complex hallucination of the senses that
led them to firmly believe they were possessed
or owned by a supernatural being
who obliged them to abdicate their free
will in his favor? Were they only, after
all, prostitutes suffering from nymphomania?
We can only insist that prostitution,
or a low standard of morality, enters largely
into the history of those <i>possessed</i> by
incubi.</p>

<p>Aside from imaginary <i>vigils</i> (Sabbat),
supposed to be frequented by those who
were really insane, it is well to remember
there were numerous houses of prostitution,
conducted by old bawds and unscrupulous
panderers, where nightly orgies
occurred and scenes of wild debauchery
were common. The real sorcerers boasted
of their magic and their relations with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>54</span>
demons, but, in reality, they knew nothing
except the art of compounding stupefying
drugs, of which they made every possible
use. Having passed their entire lives in
vice, their passions, instead of becoming
extinct, were exalted by age. “Before
ever becoming sorcerers,” remarks Professor
Thomas Erastus, “these <i>lamia</i> (magicians)
were libidinous and in close relation
with the Evil One.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Pierre Dufour, the celebrated bibliomaniac,
made a very lengthy and learned
investigation as to the connection of sorcery
with the social evil, and reaped a
veritable harvest of facts, duly authenticated
by the histories of trials for the crime
of Demonidolatry, arriving at the conclusion
that sorcery made fewer dupes than
victims. Says Dufour: “Aside from a
very small number of credulous magicians
and sorcerers, all who were initiated in the
mysteries served, or made others serve, in
the abominable commerce of debauchery.
The <i>vigil</i> offered a fine opportunity as a
spot for such turpitudes. Such reunions
of hideous companies of libertines and
prostitutes was for the profit of certain
knaves, and the sorcerers’ assemblage was
patronized by many misguided young
women, who fell from grace through libidinous
fascination.”</p>

<p>Meantime, sorcery persisted always,
notwithstanding judgments and executions.
In the year 1574, on the denunciation of
an old demented hag, eighty peasants were
burned alive at Valery, in Savoy. Three
years later nearly four hundred inhabitants
of Haut-Languedoc perished for the same
offense. In 1582 an immense number of
so-called sorcerers were executed at Avignon.
From 1580 to 1595 nine hundred
persons accused of witchcraft were put to
death.</p>

<p>In 1609, in the country of Labourde
(Basses Pyrenees), the prisons were overcrowded
with men, women and children
accused of sorcery. Fires for stake-burnt
victims lit up all the villages in the Province,
and the courts spared no one. Many
of these unfortunates accused themselves
of believing in the demons of sorcery and
having visited diabolical gatherings (<i>vigils</i>),
where they had prostituted themselves to
incubi. Others, to whom the death penalty
was meted out, were innocent persons who
had been <i>informed against</i>, but these, too,
although denying all charges, were condemned
to be burnt alive.</p>

<p>The same year some of the inhabitants
of the country of Labourde, who had
sought refuge in Spain, were accused of
having carried demons into Navarre. Five
of these unfortunates were burnt at the
stake by order of the Inquisition, one
woman being strangled and burned after
her death. Even bodies were exhumed to
be given to the flames. Eighteen persons
were permitted to make penance for their
alleged sorceries.</p>

<p>During two years, 1615 and 1616,
twenty cases of Demonidolatry were punished
in Sologne and Berry; these persons
were accused of being at a vigil, without
having been anointed with frictions however.
An old villain, aged seventy-seven
years, named Nevillon, pretended to have
seen a procession of six hundred people,
in which Satan took the shape of a ram,
or buck, and paid the sorcerers eight sous,
for the murder of a man, and five sous for
the murder of a woman. They accused
him of having killed animals by the aid of
his bewitchings. Nevillon was hung along
with those he accused. Another peasant,
by the name of Gentil Leclercq, avowed
that he was the son of a sorcerer, that he
had been baptized at the <i>vigil</i>, by a demon
called <i>Aspic</i>; he was condemned to be
hanged, and his body was burnt. The
same it was in the case of a man called
Mainguet and his wife, together with one
Antoinette Brenichon, who asserted they
had all three visited a witch reunion in
company.</p>

<p>An accusation of anthropophagy was
launched against the inhabitants of Germany,
by Innocent VIII., in 1484, and a
hundred women were also accused of
having committed murders, and cohabiting
with demons.</p>

<p>The Inquisitors inspired the story of
Nider, on the Sorceries of the Vaudois.
They found, according to the testimony of
certain witnesses, that these Vaudois cut
the throats of their infants, in order to
make magical philters, which would permit
them to traverse space to attend the
<i>vigil</i> of the witches, (<i>Sorcerers</i>). Other
persons <i>accused themselves</i> of cohabiting
with demons; some pretended they had
caused disasters, floods and tempests, by
the influence they had through Satan.
Many submitted to the most horrible
tortures with an insensibility so complete,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>55</span>
that the theologians concluded that the fat
of the first born males procured this
demonological faculty for bearing pain.
This general anæsthesia permits us to
affirm that these unfortunates were neuropathic.</p>

<p>It would be a difficult matter to
establish the exact number of victims
offered up to the fanaticism of the Inquisition.
Already, in 1436, the inhabitants in
the country of Vaud, Switzerland, had
been accused of anthropophagy, of eating
their own children, in order to satisfy their
ferocious appetites. Some one said they
had submitted to the Devil, and raised the
outcry that they had eaten thirteen persons
within a very short time. Immediately
the Judge and the Prosecutor of Eude,
investigated the story. Failing to obtain the
proof of eye witnesses, they subjected,
according to Calmeil, hundreds of unfortunates
to the tortures of the rack, after
which a certain number were burned at
the stake. Entire families overpowered by
terror, fled from home, and found refuge
in more hospitable lands; but fanaticism
and death followed them like a plague.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The moral and physical torture, undergone
by those who were suspected of this
anthropophagical sorcery, made some of the
victims confess that they had the power to
kill infants, by uttering charm words, and
that ointments made of baby fat gave
them the power to fly through the air at
pleasure; that the practice of Demonic
science permitted them to cause cows and
sheep to abort, and, that they could make
thunder and hail storms, and destroy the
crops of others; that they could create
flood and pestilence, etc. This was the
anthropophagical epidemic of 1436.</p>

<p>The same observations might be made
regarding what was known as lycanthrophy,
which always arose among the
possessed and sorcerers; that is to say
crazy people, especially those of the
monomaniac type, accused themselves and
others with imaginary crimes, in confessions
made to judges. As an example, we can
cite the case of the peasant, spoken of by
Job Fincel, and also one mentioned by
Pierre Burgot, of Verdun, who did not
hesitate to assert themselves to be guilty of
lycanthrophy. They were burned alive at
Poligny, but the remains of the five
women and children, whose flesh they
pretended to have devoured, were never
found. In order to transform themselves
into wolves, they claimed to use a pomade
given them by the Devil; and, while in a
certain condition, they copulated with
female wolves. Jean Wier has written
long essays on this last case of lycomania,
and thinks the malady of these two men
was due to narcotics, of which they made
habitual use; but Calmeil is inclined to
consider, that in a general manner, lycomania
is a partial delerium confined to
homicidal monomaniacs. This appreciation
of the case seems justified by the similar
one of Gilles Gamier, who was convinced
that he had killed four children, and eaten
their flesh. He was condemned to be
burnt at the stake at Dole, as a wehr-wolf,
(<i>loupe garron</i>), and the peasants of the
suburbs were authorized by the same order
to kill off all men like him. But we must
not conclude from this particular instance,
that a general law existed on the subject.</p>

<p>In 1603, the Parliament of Bordeaux,
thought itself liberal in admitting attenuating
circumstantial evidence, in the case of
a boy from Roche Chalais, named Jean
Grenier, who was accused of lycanthropy,
by three young peasants. In the trial, no
attempt was made to find evidence, the
accused confessed all that was desired,
and he was sentenced to imprisonment for
life, before which verdict was announced,
the Court said, that having taken into
consideration the age and imbecility of
this patient, who was so stupid that an idiot
or child of seven years would know better,
it added mercy to the judgment.”</p>

<p>He was then one of the imbeciles of
the village, such as we see in asylums for
insane, whose presence we rid ourselves of
by isolation in charitable institutions.</p>

<p>At the same epoch, in the space of two
years, 1598 to 1600, we can count the
number of poor wretches of the Jura,
whose poverty compelled them to beg
nourishment, and who were almost all condemned
to death as Demonidolators and lycanthropes.
Ready and only too willing to
leave this world, these poor people answered
all questions as to accusation in the affirmative,
and went to death with the greatest
indifference. The infamous prosecutor,
Bouget, who was sent into the Jura as a
criminal agent, boasted that he had
executed alone more than six hundred of
these innocents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>56</span></p>

<p>The Inquistorial terror then reigned
supreme; and it was only with extreme
difficulty, at that time, that a poor idiot,
named Jacques Roulet, condemned to
death as a lycanthrope by the criminal
Judge of Angers, was placed in an asylum
for idiots, by order of the Parliament of
Paris; this, too, in the seventeenth century.</p>


<h3>THE HYSTERO-DEMONOMANIA OF THE
CLOISTER.</h3>

<p>The demonomaniacal hysteria of the
Cloister, of which we have enumerated a
few examples of a most remarkable kind,
was present, in the Middle Ages, in the
form of an epidemic neurosis, characterized
by complex disturbances of the nervous
system between the life of relation and
of organic life; that is to say, by functional
symptoms dependent on the general sensibility
of the organs of sense, the active
organs of movement, and the intelligence.
In our observations we shall consequently
recognize:</p>

<p><i>Hyperæsthesia and spasm of the stomach
and abdominal organs</i>, in the hallucination
of poisoning by witches.</p>

<p><i>Hyperæsthesia of the ovary and the uterus
and vagina</i>, from the hallucination of painful
cohabitation with incubi.</p>

<p><i>Spasms of the pharynx and laryngeal
muscles</i>: coughs, screams and barks of
the prodromic period to convulsive
attacks.</p>

<p><i>Vaso-motor disturbances</i>, in the cutaneous
marks, which are attributed to the Devil,
but are simply produced by contact with
some foreign body.</p>

<p><i>Somnambulism</i>, in the execution of movements
(sometimes in opposition with the
laws of equilibrium), in a lucid state of
mind, outside the condition of wakefulness,
with or without mediumistic faculties and
the conservation of memory; in the perception
of sensations, without the intervention
of the senses; in sensorial hallucinations
produced by a simple touch; in <i>ecstasy</i>,
with loss of tactile sense and hallucinations
of vision.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p><i>Suggestion</i>, unconsciously provoked in
rapid modifications of sensibility, in alterations
of motility, in automatic movements
executed in <i>imitation</i> (<i>one form of suggestion</i>),
or by the domination of a foreign willpower,
and, in general, <i>in the penetration of
an idea or phenomenon into the brain</i>, by
word, gesture, sight, or thought.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p><i>Catalepsy</i>, in the immobility of the
body, the fixity of the regard, and the
rigidity of the limbs in all attitudes, that
we desire to place them (<i>a very rare</i> phenomenon).</p>

<p><i>Lethargy</i>, in the depression of all parts
of the body, and a predisposition on the
part of the muscles to contract.</p>

<p><i>Delirium, finally</i>, in the impossibility of
hoping to discern false from true sensations.</p>

<p>We find, after this, that in analyzing
the principal symptoms of hystero-demonomania,
we easily note the characteristics of
ordinary hysterical folly; we see that <i>it
always attacks</i> by preference the impressionable
woman. She who is fantastic,
superstitious, hungry for notoriety, full of
emotions,—one who possesses to the highest
degree the gift of assimilation and imitation,—the
subject of nightmare, nocturnal
terrors, palpitations of the heart; a
woman fickle in sentiment, one passing
easily from joy to sadness, from chastity to
lubricity,—a woman, in a word, who is
capable of all manner of deceit and simulation,
a natural-born deceiver.</p>

<p>The attacks of delirium among hystero-demonomaniacs
have always a pronounced
acute character; but, although violent
and repeated, they are liable to disappear
rapidly, and are often followed by relapse.
These attacks of delirium are
observed:</p>

<p>1. <i>Before the convulsive attacks</i>, under
the form of melancholia or agitation, with
hallucinations of sight and hearing.</p>

<p>2. <i>During convulsive attacks</i>, in the
period of passional attitudes, under the
most varied forms, by gestures in co-ordination
with the hallucinations observed by
the mind of the patient; we often see such
persons express the most opposite sentiments—piety,
erotism, and terror.</p>

<p>3. <i>After convulsive attacks</i>, in the form<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>57</span>
of despair, shame, rage, sadness, with an
abundant shedding of tears.</p>

<p>4. <i>Without convulsive attacks</i>; in that
case, the delirium may occur at any period;
it is masked hysteria, which has a very
great analogy to masked epilepsy.</p>

<p>The delirium of these patients, <i>en resume</i>,
has for essential characteristics, exaltation
of the intelligence, peculiar fixity of
ideas, perversion of the sentiments, absence
of will power, tendency to erotism. In a
number of observations on delirium among
hysterical cases in a state of hypnotism recently
published, patients have been noted
who believed that they cohabited with cats
and monkeys, while some had hallucinations
of phantoms and assassins—visions
that resulted from complex hallucinations
and have a certain similarity to those of
hystero-demonomania observed in the
Middle Ages; and, if the demons did
not actually play the principle <i>role</i> in these
hallucinations, it is because the imagination
had not the anterior nourishment and belief
in supernaturalism and no faith in the
sexual relations of demons with mankind.</p>

<p>It was in 1491, about the time Jeanne
Pothiere was on trial, that it was noticed
that young girls in religious communities
were subject to an epidemic mental affection,
which led its victims to declare that
they had fallen into the power of evil
spirits. This species of delirium betrayed
itself to the eyes of its observers by a series
of strange and extravagant acts. These
patients at once pretended to be able to
read the future and prophesy. (See Calmeil,
work cited.)</p>

<p>Abusive religious practices, false ideas
of the future life, a tendency to mysticism,
the fear of Hell and the snares of the Devil,
the development of hysterical neurosis, in
one subject, into suggestion inherent to
imitation; such was the succinct history of
the epidemic of the nuns of Cambrai.
Jeanne Pothiere, their companion, denounced
by them, was condemned to perpetual
imprisonment, for having cohabited
“434 times” (so the nuns said) with a Demon,
and having introduced the lustful
devil into their before peaceful convent.
For it could have been nothing less than a
demon that chased the poor young nuns
across the fields and assisted them to climb
trees, where, suspended from the branches,
they were inspired to divine hidden things,
to foretell the future, and be the victims of
convulsions.</p>

<p>Sixty years later, in 1550, there suddenly
occurred a great number of hystero-demonomaniacal
epidemics similar to that
in the convent of Cambrai. The nuns of
Uvertet, following a strict fast, were attacked
by divers nervous disorders. During
the night they heard groans, when they
burst out in peals of hysterical laughter;
following this manifestation, they claimed
they were lifted out of their beds by a
superior force; they had, at the same time,
contractions in the muscles of the limbs
and of the face. They attacked each other
in wild frenzy, giving and taking furious
blows; at other times they were found on
the ground, as though “inanimate,” and to
this species of lethargy succeeded a maniacal
agitation of great violence. Like the nuns
of Cambrai, they climbed trees and ran
over the branches as agile as so many cats,
descending head downwards with feet in
the air. These manifestations were, of
course, attributed to a compact with the
Devil, and the officers of the law, acting
on the accusations of these nuns, arrested
a midwife residing in the neighborhood, on
the charge of witchcraft (<i>sorcery</i>). It is
needless to add that the midwife died soon
after.</p>

<p>A neurosis almost similar occurred the
same year among the nuns at Saint
Brigette’s Convent. In their attacks these
nuns imitated the cries of animals and the
bleating of sheep. At chapel one after the
other were taken with convulsive syncope,
followed by suffocation and œsophageal
spasms, which sometimes persisted for the
space of several days and condemned the
victims to an enforced fast. This epidemic
commenced after an hysterical convulsion
occurred in one of the younger nuns, who
had entered the convent on account of
disappointment in love. Convinced that
this unfortunate creature had imported
a devil into the religious community, she
was banished to one of the prisons of the
Church.</p>

<p>At about this same time another epidemic
of hystero-demonomania broke out
at the Convent of Kintorp, near Strasbourg.
These nuns insisted that they were
possessed. Convulsions and muscular contractions
which followed these attacks,
along with delirium, were attributed to
epilepsy. Progressively, and as though by
contagion, all the nuns were stricken.
When the hysterical attack arrived they
uttered howls, like animals, then assaulted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>58</span>
each other violently, biting with their teeth
and scratching with finger-nails. Among
those having convulsions the muscles of
the pharynx participated in the general
spasmodic condition. The attack was announced
by a fetid breath and a sensation
of burning at the soles of the feet. One
day some of the young sisters denounced
the convent cook, Elise Kame, as a sorcerer,
although she suffered like the others
from convulsive hysteria. This accusation
finished the poor girl, who, together with
her mother, was committed alive to the
flames. Their death, most naturally, did
not relieve the convent of the disease; the
nervous malady, on the contrary, spread
around in the neighborhood of the institution,
attacking married women and young
girls, whose imaginations were overpowered
by the recital of occurrences within
the convent walls.</p>

<p>We must admit that at that period
doctors confounded hysteria with epilepsy.
Spasms of the larynx, muscular
contractions that we of the present day
can provoke experimentally, as well as
other phenomena of hysterical convulsions
in somnambulic phases of hypnotism, were
considered at that period only the manifest
signs of diabolical possession. As to the
stinking breath, which revealed the presence
of the Devil among the nuns, that is
a frequent symptom in grave affections of
the nervous system; it is often a prodroma
of an attack or series of maniacal convulsions.
We have found that this fetidity of
breath coincides with the nauseating odor
of sweat and urine, to which we attribute
the same semeological value as that of
the mouth.</p>

<p>Another epidemic of hysterical convulsions,
complicated with nymphomania,
occurred at Cologne in 1554, in the Convent
of Nazareth. Jean Wier, who was
sent to examine these patients, recognized
that the nuns were possessed by the Demon
of lubricity and debauchery, who ruled
this convent to a frightful extent.</p>

<p>P. Bodin has himself furnished the
proofs; it was this author who wrote the
history of erotic nuns. He remarks:
“Sometimes the bestial appetites of some
women lead them to believe in a demon;
this occurred in the year 1566, in the Diocese
of Cologne, where a dog was found
which, it was claimed, was inhabited by a
demon; this animal bit the religious ladies
under their skirts. It was not a demon,
but a natural dog. A woman who confessed
to sinning with a dog was once
burned at Toulouse.</p>

<p>“But it may be that Satan is sometimes
sent by God, as certain it is that all punishment
comes from him, through his means
or without his means to avenge such
crimes, as happened in a convent in Hesse,
in Germany, where the nuns were demonomaniacs
and sinned in a horrible manner
with an animal.”</p>

<p>Thus says Bodin, the public prosecutor
of sorcerers among the laity and the religious
orders. Would he not have shown
much greater wisdom if he had humanely
judged the actions of mankind, and had
condemned as social absurdities the innumerable
convents and monasteries to
which the fanaticism of the Middle Ages
attracted so many men and women who
might have followed more useful avocations?
The convulsions of nymphomaniac
girls were very wild, and diversified by
curious movements of the pelvis, while
lying in a position of dorsal decubitus, with
closed eyelids. After such attacks these
poor nervous nuns were perfectly prostrated,
and only breathed with the greatest
difficulty. It was thus with young Gertrude,
who was first attacked by a convulsive
neurosis which it was claimed had
been induced by nymphomaniac practices
in the convent, and that evil spirits possessed
these nuns.</p>

<p>In 1609, hystero-demonomania made
victims in the Convent of Saint Ursula, at
Aix. Two nuns were said to be <i>possessed</i>;
these were Madeleine de Mandoul and
Loyse Capel. They were exorcised without
success. Led to the Convent of Saint
Baume, they denounced Louis Gaufridi,
priest of the Church of Acoules of Marseilles,
as being a sorcerer, who had bewitched
them.</p>

<p>The Inquisitor Michaelis has left us the
history of this trial by exorcism. These
patients had all the symptoms of convulsive
hysteria, with nymphomania, catalepsy,
and hallucinatory delirium. This Judge,
however, only saw in these manifestations
the work of several demons, who tormented
these nuns one after, the other, at the
instigation of the priest, Louis Gaufridi,
who was arrested, tried, condemned by the
executioner, and led to the gallows with a
rope around his neck, in bare feet, a torch
in hand; thus punished, the unfortunate
and innocent priest fell into a state of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>59</span>
dementia, and while in this condition confessed
that he was the author of the nuns’
demonomania.</p>

<p>As soon as Gaufridi had been sentenced
to death by the Inquisition, the
nuns of Saint Brigette’s Convent, at Lille,
who had assisted at the exorcism of the
nuns of Saint Ursula, in turn were attacked
by hystero-demonomania. The report soon
spread that they, too, were possessed, and
the Inquisitor Michaelis came to Avignon
to exorcise the demons. One of these
nuns, Marie de Sains, suspected of sorcery,
was sent to jail. Three of her companions,
treated by exorcism, denounced
the unfortunate girl as a witch. Marie de
Sains, who, up to this time, had asserted
innocence, finished by declaring herself
guilty towards the rest of the nuns in the
cloister. The demons found under the
nuns’ beds were placed there, according
to Marie’s statement, by the unfortunate
Gaufridi.</p>

<p>She testified that, “the Devil, to recompense
the priest, gave him the title of
‘Prince of Magicians;’ and promised me,”
added the nun, “all kinds of sovereign
honors for having consented to poison the
other nuns’ minds by witchcraft. Sister
Joubert, Sister Bolonais, Sister Fournier,
Sister Van der Motte, Sister Launoy, and
Sister Peronne, who were first to have
symptoms of <i>possession</i> through diabolical
power, soon fell under the action of the
potent philter. The witchcraft was made
with the host and consecrated blood, powdered
billy goat horns, human bones, skulls
of children, hair, finger-nails, flesh, and
seminal fluid from the sorcerer; by adding
to this mixture pieces of the human liver,
spleen, and brain, Lucifer gave to the hideous
melange a virtue of terrible strength.
The sorcerers who gave this horrible concoction
to their acquaintances not only
destroyed them, but also a large number of
new-born children.”</p>

<p>This unfortunate, besides, accused herself
of having caused the death of a number
of persons, including children, the
mother, and often godmother; she claimed
to have administered debilitating powders
to many others. She confessed to casting
an evil spell on the other nuns, which had
given them over to lubricity; declared she
had been to the witch <i>vigils</i> and cohabited
with devils, and that she had also committed
sodomy, had intercourse with <i>dogs</i>,
<i>horses</i>, and <i>serpents</i>; finally, she acknowledged
that she had accorded her favors to
the priest, Louis Gaufridi, whereas the nun
was really innocent.</p>

<p>Marie de Sains was found guilty of being
possessed by a demon. She was exorcised
and condemned to perpetual imprisonment
and most austere penances by the
Court of Tournay.</p>

<p>Immediately after the trial of Marie de
Sains another nun, Simone Dourlet, was
tried for the crime of sorcery, and by force
of torture and <i>suggestions</i>, she admitted to
have been at a witch <i>vigil</i> and was guilty.
The history of this poor girl is revolting,
for not only was she innocent of all crimes
imputed to her, but she was not even sick.
She was the victim of the hallucinations of
her companions.</p>

<p>Another form of hystero- or hysterical
demonomania was observed the same year
near Dax, in the Parish of Amon, where
more than 120 women were attacked by
<i>impulsive insanity</i>, following the expression
of Calmeil, but which has been designated
by others as the <i>Mal de Laira</i>. This neurosis,
which was only a variety of hysteria,
was characterized by convulsions and loud
barking. De L’Ancre gives an interesting
description of this outbreak, but does not
fail to attribute the affection to sorcerers.
“It is a monstrous thing,” says he, “to
see in church more than forty persons, all
braying and barking like dogs, as on
nights when the moon is full. This music
is renewed on the entrance of every
new sorcerer, who has perhaps given the
disease to some other woman. These
possessed creatures commence barking
from the time they enter church.”</p>

<p>The same barking symptoms were noticed
in dwellings when these witches
passed along the street, and all passers by
commenced to bark also when a sorcerer
appeared.</p>

<p>The convulsions resembled those noticed
in enraged insane persons. During
the attack the victims would wallow on the
earth, beating the ground with their bodies
and limbs, turning their violence on their
own persons without having will power to
control their madness for evil doing. According
to Calmeil their cases were rather
hysterical than of an epileptic type.</p>

<p>A very remarkable fact in regard to
this neurosis was that those women who
howled were exempt from convulsions and
reciprocally. These howls or barks were
comparable to the cries uttered by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>60</span>
nuns of Kintorp and the bleatings of the
sisters of Saint Brigette.</p>

<p>We have also the record of a German
convent, where the nuns meowed like cats,
and ran about the cloister imitating feline
animals.</p>

<p>It is useless to add that the <i>Mal de
Laira</i> was a cause of several condemnations
of nuns who admitted they had bewitched
their companions.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Among the numerous trials for Demonidolatry,
that which has been most noted
was certainly the case of Urbain Grandier,
and the Ursulines of Loudun, from 1632
to 1639.</p>

<p>The Convent of Loudun was founded
in 1611 by a dame of Cose—Belfiel. Only
noble ladies were received therein—Claire
de Sazilli, the Demoiselles Barbezier, Madmoiselle
de la Mothe, the Demoiselles
D’Escoubleau, etc. These titled ladies
had all received brilliant educations, but
had submitted to life in a nunnery by vocation.
Seven of these young women were
suddenly attacked by hallucinations.
They all claimed to be victims of witchcraft.</p>

<p>During the night these girls went in
and out of the convent doors, sometimes
standing on their heads, as is the case with
certain individuals subject to natural
somnambulism. These nuns all accused
a chaplain of the order recently deceased
of causing their troubles, and
several of the ladies claimed that the
chaplain’s ghost made shameful propositions
to them.</p>

<p>The disease grew worse from day to
day, until Justice was called on to interfere,
when the nuns changed their minds
and declared that the real cause of their
possession was in reality one Urbain Grandier,
priest to the Church of Saint Pierre
of Loudun, a man distinguished for his
brilliant intelligence, perfect education,
but rather given to gallantry, and a desire
for public notoriety.</p>

<p>Was it Mignon, the new chaplain of the
order, who <i>suggested</i> to the nuns their pretended
persecutor?</p>

<p>That was the story, but Urbain Grandier
attached no importance to the rumor.</p>

<p>The attacks of the nuns increased more
and more, however, and were complicated
with catalepsy, ecstasy and nymphomania,
the victims making obscene and shameful
remarks. Then exorcisers were called in,
but met with no success. These ladies on
the contrary endeavored to provoke the
priests by lascivious gestures and indecent
postures. Some of them wriggled over the
floor like serpents, while others moved
their bodies backwards so that their heads
touched their heels, a motion, according
to eye-witnesses, made with the most extraordinary
quickness. At times the nuns
screamed and howled in unison like a chorus
of wild beasts.</p>

<p>A historian of the time, De Le Menardy,
witness <i>de visu et de auditu</i>, has written:
“In their contortions they were as
supple and easily bent as a piece of lead—in
such a way that their bodies could be
bent in any form—backwards, forwards
and sidewise, even so the head touched the
earth, and they remained in these positions
up to such a time as their attitudes might
be changed.” These movements were
especially produced during the time of the
attempted exorcisms. At the first mention
of Satan “they raised up, passed their toes
behind their necks, and, with legs separated,
rested themselves on their perinæums
and gave themselves up to indecent
manual motions.” They were
delirious at this time from demonomanical
excitement. Madam de Belfiel claimed to
be sitting on seven devils, Madam de Sazilli
had ten demons under her, while Sister
Elizabeth modestly asserted her number
of imps to be five.</p>

<p>During the exorcisms these poor women
<i>fell sound asleep</i>, which induces Calmeil to
think “the condition of these women resembled
closely that of <i>magnetic somnambulists</i>.”
This supposition would permit us to
explain the impossibility of the nuns telling
on certain days what they had said or done
during the course of a nervous attack.
The days when they escaped <i>contortions</i>—when
they were to the contrary violently
exalted by the nature of these tactile and
visceral sensations—they recalled too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>61</span>
much, for the power of reflection disgusted
these unfortunates with their own vile and
uncontrollable acts and assertions.</p>

<p>This epidemic had continued fifteen
months, and all the Ursuline nuns had
been attacked by the epidemic when Laubardemont,
one of the secret agents of the
Cardinal Richelieu, arrived at Loudun to
examine into the alleged Demonidolatry
said to exist in the convent. The Cardinal
had given this agent absolute and extended
power. Urbain Grandier, who was the
author of a libel against Richelieu, was arrested
for complicity in this sorcery, and
brought before a commission of Justices,
whose members had been chosen by Laubardemont.
He was confronted by the
nuns, invited to exorcise them, and then
subjected to most cruel tortures. Iron needle
points were stuck in his skin, all over
the body, in order to find anæsthetised
points, which were the pretended marks of
the Devil.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his protestations of innocence,
the Judges taking the acts of the
accusers while in the poor priest’s presence,
for his appearance was the signal for scenes
of the most violent frenzy, condemned the
man to be tied to a gallows alive. There
he was subjected to renewed tortures,
while the various muscles of his body were
torn apart and his bones broken.</p>

<p>The punishment of Urbain Grandier
did not put an end to the epidemic of hysterical
demonomania among the Ursulines,
for the malady extended to the people of
the town, even to the monks who were
charged with conducting the exorcisms;
but the vengeance of his Red Eminence
(Cardinal Richelieu) was satisfied.</p>

<p>Many commentaries have been made
since then on this outbreak of Demonidolatry
among the Ursulines. These we have
no desire to reproduce nor to discuss, as it
would only tend to show the ancient ignorance
prevailing regarding diseases of the
nervous system, and the want of character
and weakness of the physicians of that
epoch, together with the fanaticism of the
monks and priesthood. One thing, however,
appears to be worthy of remembrance;
that is the analogy between the convulsive
symptoms observed among the nuns and the
phenomena of somnambulism described
by Calmeil. This fact appears to us as so
much the more remarkable, as the learned
doctor of Charenton was a declared adversary
of magnetism, and published his work
almost half a century since—that is, in
1845.</p>

<p>The sleep into which the nuns fell during
the period of exorcism, the forgetfulness
of the scenes witnessed where they
had played such a <i>role</i>, are, to our mind, only
phenomena of hypnotism, and the resemblance
is so strong that we do not believe
it would be impossible to artificially
reproduce another epidemic of hysterical
demonomania.</p>

<p>Let us for an instant accept the <i>hypothesis</i>
of a convent, where twenty young nuns
are confined. Of these at least ten will be
subject to hypnotism. Let us now admit
that these recluses, living the ordinary
ascetic and virtuous life of the cloister,
plunged deeply in the mysticisms of the
Catholic faith, receive one day as confessor
and spiritual director a man of energetic
character, knowing all the practices of
<i>hypnotism</i> and of <i>suggestion</i>—a disciple let
us say of Puel, Charcot, De Luys, Barety,
Bernheim—a perfect neurologist. Now, if
this man cared to magnetize individually
each of these nuns in the silence and obscurity
of the confessional, and should
then suggest to them that they were <i>possessed</i>
by all the demons known to sorcery, what
would occur? Let us suppose again that
he should carry his physiological power
further and put his <i>subjects</i> into an ecstacy,
catalepsy or lethargy—into a condition
where marked hallucinations might occur
and nervous excitation be provoked, how
long would it be before this man could
make these women similar to those who
once lived in the convent of the Ursulines
at Loudun?</p>

<p>We have not admitted this fiction for the
purpose of having any one conclude that
the possessed of Loudun were the mere
playthings of some person who used hypnotism
in an interest that we ignore; but,
if this fact may be considered possible
by the will of an individual, who can
affirm at this day that there does not
exist an unknown force, intelligent or
not, capable of producing the same pathological
phenomena observed long ago?
What we call, in 1888, hypnotism in the
amphitheatres of our universities, we reserve
for another chapter, where we will
give revelations much more extraordinary,
and also more supernatural; our chapter
on the neurology of the nineteenth century
will, we promise, be <i>very interesting</i>.</p>

<p>Let us yet remark that the hystero-demonomaniacal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>62</span>
manifestations were not
peculiar to the Ursulines of Loudun. They
have been observed in many convents in
the same conditions of habits and prolonged
fastings among debilitated young
girls; from long vigils spent in prayer and
nervous depression, caused by over-religious
discipline; by mystical exhortations
from a man invested in a sacred character,
on whom fall all the discussions, all the
entreaties, and all the thoughts of the girls
in the cloister.</p>

<p>The history of the nuns of Loudun was
identically reproduced under the same
conditions among the sisters of Saint Elizabeth’s
Convent at Louviers, in 1643, three
years after the execution of poor Urbain
Grandier for witchcraft.</p>

<p>In a short time eighteen nuns were
attacked with hysterical demonomania;
they had active hallucinations of all the
senses, convulsions, and delirium. Like
the Ursulines, they blasphemed, screamed,
and gave themselves over to all manner of
strange contortions, claiming to be <i>possessed</i>
by demons, describing in obscene terms
the orgies of the witch vigil (<i>Sabbat</i>), perpetrating
all varieties of debauchery, even
unknown to the vilest prostitutes; after
this they finally accused one or more persons
of bewitching them through sorcery.</p>

<p>The nuns of Louviers, for instance,
after being duly exorcised according to the
Canons of the Church, accused as the
author of their affliction, and as a bad
magician, their old time confessor, the
Abbot Picard, who died before their symptoms
were developed; then they accused
another priest, by the name of Francois
Boulle, and several of their companions,
notably Sister Madeleine Bavan. These
innocent people were tried by the Parliament
of Rouen, who ordered that the body
of the priest, Picard, should be exhumed,
carried to the stake, there tied to the living
body of Francois Boulle, and after being
burnt their ashes should be cast to the
winds. This execution, in the open air,
occurred in the seventeenth century, in the
“Old Market Place” at Rouen, at the spot
where Joan d’Arc had also been burnt
alive for being <i>possessed</i>, as was claimed, by
supernatural beings. What a comment on
intelligence in an age of partial enlightenment!</p>

<p>In order to close this chapter on hysterical
demonomania among religious orders,
of which we have given some
examples, we shall cite an interesting relation
left us by the Bishops and Doctors of Sorbonne,
together with the testimony of the
King’s deputies, regarding the <i>possession</i> of
nuns at the Convent of Auxonne. Here
there were always convulsions and screams,
with blasphemy, aversion to taking the sacraments,
possession, and exorcisms; and
there was, undoubtedly, the phenomenon of
<i>suggestion</i> observed with much precision.</p>

<p>We might say that the nuns of Auxonne
were accessible to suggestion; for, at the
command or even the thought of the exorcists,
they fell into a condition of somnambulism;
in this state they became insensible
to pain, as was determined by pricking
Sister Denise under the finger-nail with a
needle; they had also the faculty of
prosternating the body, making it assume
the form of a circle,—in other words, they
could bend their limbs in any direction.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Chalons reports that
“all the before mentioned girls, secular as
well as regular, to the number of eighteen,
<i>had the gift of Language</i>, and responded to
the exorcists <i>in Latin</i>, making, at times,
their entire conversation in the classical
tongue.</p>

<p>“Almost all these nuns had a full
knowledge of the secrets and inner thoughts
of others;<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> this was demonstrated particularly
<i>in the interior commandments</i>, which
had been made by the exorcists on different
occasions, which they obeyed exactly
ordinarily, <i>without the commandments being
expressed to them either by words or any external
sign</i>.</p>

<p>“The Bishop himself, among others, experimented
on the person of Denise Pariset,
to whom, <i>giving a command mentally to
come to him immediately and be exorcised</i>,
whereupon the aforesaid nun immediately
came to him, although her residence was
in a quarter of the village far removed
from the Episcopal residence. She said
on these occasions that she was commanded
to come; and this experiment was repeated
several times.</p>

<p>“Again, in the person of Sister Jamin,
a novice, who on hearing the exorcism,
told the Bishop his interior commandment
made to the Demon during the ceremony.
Also, in the person of Sister Borthon, who,
being <i>commanded mentally</i> to make her
agitations violent, immediately prostrated
herself before the Holy Sacrament, with her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>63</span>
belly against the earth and her arms extended,
executing the command at the
same instant, with a promptitude and precipitation
wholly extraordinary.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Here, I believe, are facts so well
authenticated of transmission of thought or
of mental <i>suggestions</i>, perhaps <i>voluntarily
unknown</i> to certain modern neurologists.
These neuropaths of Auxonne presented
still more extraordinary phenomena; at
the word of command they suspended the
pulsations of the pulse in an arm, in the
right arm, for example, and transfered the
beatings from the right arm to the left
arm, and <i>vice versa</i>. This fact was discovered
by the Bishop, and many ecclesiastics
verified the same, and “it was promptly
done in the presence of Doctor Morel,
who recognized and makes oath to the
fact.”</p>

<p>We cannot dwell too long on the Demonomania
of the Middle Ages, to which we
have, perhaps, added some historical facts
which are new and which we believe
it to be our duty to publish, seeing a
connection with modern hypnotism. We
shall thus open a new field for investigation
on strange affections, classed up to
the present time in all varieties of monomania,
but which appear to us to
belong to a variety of mental pathology
independent of insanity, properly speaking.
If it were otherwise it would be necessary
to recognize as crazy persons, not only the
Demonomaniacs of the Middle Ages, but
also the Jansenists, who went into trances,
and the choreics and convulsionists (<i>convulsionnaires</i>)
of the eighteenth century.
They were certainly not crazy, those who
came to the mortuary of Saint Medard, to
the tomb of the Deacon Paris, to make an
appeal against the Papal bull of Clement
XI. And was it not another cause than
auto suggestion, to which it is necessary to
attribute the nervous phenomena that the
<i>appelants</i> exhibited during thirty consecutive
years?</p>

<p>The exaltation of religious ideas, so
often advanced by psychologists, cannot
account for these phenomena. I have seen
palpable proofs of this in the various accidents
that suddenly overcame sceptics and
strong-minded men of modern times, who
came as amateurs to assist at the experiments
on convulsive subjects. These
symptoms, as is well known, are usually
ushered in by violent screams, rapid beatings
of the heart, contractions of muscles,
and analogous nervous symptoms.</p>

<p>Besides, it is incontestible that many
patients and infirm people obtain an unhoped
for cure following convulsive cries;
while others, in a state of health, are taken
with hallucinations and delirium. I have
seen patients who would lacerate certain
portions of the body that were the seat of
burns, and continue to walk, cry, gesticulate,
and abuse themselves, like insane
persons in a real state of dementia.</p>

<p>The Jansenists did not speak, had no
compacts with demons, no exorcisms at
which Inquisitors and their acolytes could
suggest ideas of demonomania; and notwithstanding
their great austerities and the
most rigorous fasts, we note among the
<i>convulsionnaires</i> of Saint Medard only the
ideas of possession by the Holy Spirit and
divine favors obtained through the protection
of the kind-hearted Deacon; and
meantime, those possessed by God, as by
the Devil, were subjects of somnambulism,
to trances, lethargy, catalepsy, and other
phenomena.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The last analogy, finally, between the two
nervous epidemics, was the Royal authority,
a special form of <i>suggestion</i> in the
Middle Ages, which put an end to sorcery
or witchcraft as well as to Jansenism.</p>


<h3>HYSTERIA AND PSYCHIC FORCE.</h3>

<p>Among the phenomena observed in
demonomaniacal hysteria there are some,
as we have remarked, that modern neurologists
have wished to <i>pass over in silence</i>,
because it was impossible to give a rational
explanation. It arose from that mysterious
force which acts upon the human personality
and its faculties and produces
<i>supernatural results</i> in contradiction to well
known scientific laws, known in one sense
as <i>Psychic Force</i>, but which is nothing else
than <i>modern spiritualism</i>.</p>

<p>This force, a power possessed in a high
degree not only by hysterical persons, but
all varieties of neuropaths, who are designated
as <i>mediums</i> by spiritual psychologists,
<i>cannot be doubted by real scientists to day</i>.</p>

<p>The demonologists of the Middle Ages
have often mentioned it in the demonomaniacs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>64</span>
and attributed it to possession by
evil spirits; and, if not pathologists, <i>they
did not disdain to occupy themselves with something
that tends to simplify the study of the
physiology of the nervous system</i>; but to minds
of the modern type, that consider science
as synonymous with truth, it seems strange
and incomprehensible that our learned investigators
should have been overpowered
by the fear of the criticism that might
overtake them because <i>they cannot explain
purely and simply an inexplicable fact, a truth,
real positive and certain</i>.</p>

<p>Not being ourselves timorous to this
prudence, which is, they claim, one of the
conditions, <i>sine qua non</i>, to be a candidate
for the Institute of France, we shall now
pursue our investigations with the historical
documents regarding the medical
Middle Age we possess, and thus loyally
seek a scientific interpretation for facts observed
in modern spiritualism or <i>psychic
force</i>.</p>

<p>Among these documents we will choose
as a type the “Trial made to deliver a girl
possessed by the Evil Spirit, at Louviers.”
This suit, which dates back to 1591, is in
reality a series of trials written up by
several magistrates, in the presence of
numerous witnesses, reporting with precision
all facts observed by them—facts interpreted,
it is true, with ideas of the demonidolatry
of the sixteenth century, but
having a character whose authenticity is
undisputed, and <i>even undiscussed</i>. The first
trial is thus conceived:<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>“On Saturday, the 18th day of August,
1591, in the morning at Louviers, in the
aforesaid place, before us, Louis Morel,
Councillor of the King, Provost General
and Marshal of France for the Province of
Normandy, holding Court in the service of
the King in the villages and castles of
Pont de l’Arche and Louviers, with one
lieutenant, one recorder, and fifty archers,
assisted by Monsieur Behotte, licentiate of
law, Judge Advocate and Lieutenant General
of Monsieur the Viscount of Rouen,
in the presence of Louis Vauquet, our
clerk.” * * *</p>

<p>This old document, in French now
almost obsolete and difficult of translation,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
goes on to state that in a house at
Louviers, belonging to Mrs. Gay, two
officers, belonging to the troops occupying
the town, who had temporary quarters with
Gay, complained to their commandant that
“a spirit in the house mentioned tormented
them.” Now, this house was occupied
by three ladies: Madame Gay, one of her
friends, a widow named Deshayes, and a
servant girl called Francoise Fontaine.</p>

<p>Captain Diacre, who was commandant
of the village, found on investigation the
general disorder of the residence, the furniture
turned upside down, the two ladies
terrified, and the servant girl with several
wounds on her body. The latter was suspected
of being in league with the Devil,
and was arrested and cast into the prison
of the town. On her person was found a
purse containing a teston (old French
coin), a half teston, and a ten-sous piece.
The trial proved nothing. The ladies
might have had nightmare, the officers
might have been drunk, the noises heard
might have been the result of a thousand
different causes, but it is necessary to mention
this case in order to comprehend the
subsequent trials.</p>

<p>The second trial, witnessed, tried, and
authenticated by the same authorities, determined
the fact that Francoise Fontaine
was born at Paris, Faubourg Saint Honore,
and that at the age of twenty two years she
had already witnessed similar phenomena
in a house “haunted,” said she, “by evil
spirits that frightened her so much that she
went to a neighbor’s to sleep while her
mistress was absent from home.” This
statement was proved correct in six subsequent
trials containing the depositions of
Marguerite Prevost, Suzanne Le Chevalier,
Marguerite Le Chevalier, and Perrine
Fayel.</p>

<p>The following trial states that on Saturday,
the 31st of August, 1591, before
Louis Morel, Councillor of the King,
assisted by his clerk, Louis Vauquet, etc.,
etc.,</p>

<p>“Came Pierre Alix, first jailer and
guard of the prison, who threw himself on
his two knees before us, holding the prison
keys in his hand, pale and overcome by
emotion; for which action we remonstrated,
when he stated to our great astonishment
that he did not wish to longer act as
prison guard, for the reason that the evil
spirit that tormented the aforesaid Francoise
Fontaine likewise tormented him, and also
the prisoners, who desired to break jail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>65</span>
and fly in order to save themselves, having
a presentement that the aforesaid Francoise
Fontaine, was in a dungeon or pit,
and <i>that she had removed a great iron
door that had fallen upon her afterwards</i>;
and several persons having ran to her
along with the jailer found the aforesaid
Fontaine acting as though possessed by an
evil spirit, with her throat swollen,” etc.</p>

<p>Let us pass over an interminable recital
made by Francoise Fontaine to the priests
and counsellors of the King, relative to
<i>diabolic possession</i>, to which she had been
subject all her life. Also, as to the testimony
of many witnesses as to her performance
while in jail; as, for instance, “the
body of Francoise rose in the air about
four feet, without being in contact with
anything, and she floated towards us in the
air,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>Francois Fontaine claimed that she had
consented to belong to the Demon, who
was “a black man with whom she had
cohabited.” Considered from a medical
standpoint the girl was a victim to hysterical
demonomania.</p>

<p>Let us make a few more extracts from
the records of this trial:</p>

<p>“As the aforesaid Fontaine told us
these things, being meantime on her two
knees before us, who were seated on a
raised platform, the aforesaid Fontaine fell
forward on her face as though she had
been struck from above, and the candles
in the chandeliers of the room were extinguished,
except those on the clerk’s
table, the which were roughly blown upon
several times without being put out, when
no visible person present was near them to
blow, and these candles were raised out of
their candlesticks, lighted as they were,
and rubbed against the ground in an attempt
to extinguish them, and the which were finally
extinguished with a great noise, without
any human hand appearing near them;
the which so astonished the priest, the advocate,
the first jailer, the archers guard,
who were present, that they retired, leaving
us alone, the hour being then nine
o’clock at night.</p>

<p>“Finding myself alone, I recommended
my soul to God, and exclaimed in a
loud voice the words, ‘My God, give me
grace not to lose my soul to the Devil, and
I command thee O, Demon, by the power
I have invoked, to leave the body of
Francoise Fontaine! Again I repeat the
command!’”</p>

<p>At the same instant the exorcist felt
himself seized by the legs, arms and body,
and tightly held in the arms of an unknown
force, which felt hot and blew a warm
breath, while blows were rained on the
Judge’s body as though he were beaten by
a heavy piece of wood. He was struck on
the jaw and under the ear hard enough to
draw blood, etc.</p>

<p>At the eleventh trial it was found that
Francoise Fontaine was bodily raised out
of bed during the night by an unseen
force, and this fact is duly authenticated
by witnesses.</p>

<p>In the following trial the same phenomena
were produced in the church at
Louviers, during the mass of exorcism,
where:</p>

<p>“Francoise Fontaine floated from the
earth into the air, higher than the altar, as
though lifted up by the hair by an unseen
hand, which quickly alarmed the assistants,
who had never before witnessed such an
occurrence,” etc.</p>

<p>In presence of these facts Francoise
was led back to prison, and it was decided
by the clerical council, assisted by two
eminent physicians, Roussel and Gautier,
to cut off the girl’s hair, as was the custom
when witches were arrested.</p>

<p>During this operation, which was performed
publically by Dr. Gautier, the same
phenomenon was reproduced. For says
the veracious old French chronicle:
“Francoise est de rechef enleuee en l’air
fort hault, la tete en bas, les pieds en hault
sans que ses accoustrementz se soient
renuersez, au trauers desquelz il sortoit par
deuant et par derriere grande quantite
d’eaue et fumee puante.”</p>

<p>Like the many preceding trials, with
experiments, which are duly attested by
magistrates, physicians and the clerk,
seven person in all, who witnessed the
phenomena, as to material facts, we
cannot suspect people whose honesty was
never doubted; for it was through their influence
that Francoise Fontaine was set at
liberty, after all her inexplicable symptoms
had disappeared and her nervous malady
abated.</p>

<p>In order to render an account of the
<i>supernatural</i> phenomena observed by early
demonographers and attributed to evil spirits,
let us briefly glance at the experiments
made regarding <i>Spiritualism</i> by a few
brave physiologists of our own epoch, who
have dared to investigate the analogy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>66</span>
existing between these two orders of phenomena.</p>

<p>Among the modern experimenters who
have made a scientific study of this subject—let
us call it <i>Psychic Force</i>, if you
will—we will mention Mr. Crookes, member
of the Royal Society of London, the
(English Academy of Sciences), the master
mind, the most illustrious in modern science;
the discoverer of thallium, radiant
matter, photometer of polarization, spectral
microscope—a chemist and physicist
of the first order, accustomed to the most
minute experimental investigations.</p>

<p>The experiments of this <i>savant</i> have
been arranged by him in three classes, as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class I.</span>—<i>Movement of weighty bodies
with contact, but without mechanical effort.</i></p>

<p>This movement is one of the most simple
forms of the phenomenon observed; it presents
degrees that vary from trembling or
vibration of the chamber and its contents
up to the complete elevation in the air,
when the hand is placed above, of a
weighty body. We commonly object that
when they touch an object put in motion,
they push, draw or raise it. I have experimentally
proved that this is impossible in
a great number of cases; but, as a matter
of evidence, I attach little importance to
that class of phenomena considered in
themselves, and have only mentioned them
as a preliminary to other movements of the
same kind, but without contact.</p>

<p>“These movements (and I may truly
add all other similar phenomena) are generally
preceded by a particular breeziness
of the air, amounting sometimes almost to
a true wind. This air disperses leaves of
paper and lowers the thermometer several
degrees.</p>

<p>“Under some circumstances, to the
subject of which I shall, at some future
day, give more details, I have not found
any of this air; but the cold was so intense
that I can only compare it to that experienced
by placing the hand at a short distance
from mercury in a state of congelation.”
(<i>Crookes</i>).</p>

<p>I have obtained, like the eminent
“member of the Royal Society of London,”
the movement of weighty bodies by
contact very easily, not only lifting massive
tables of a weight altogether out of proportion
and far superior to the force of a very
robust man, but have also seen this furniture
move in a given direction; I have
even noted a small square table keep time
in beating with a determined cadence.
This phenomenon, well known to all experimenters,
may be reproduced without
the assistance of a powerful medium; it
was well known in times of antiquity, but
is not mentioned in the writings on sorcery
during the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>As extraordinary as these facts seem,
they are no more singular than those observed
by W. Crookes, and very recently
by Zoellner,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Professor in the University
of Leipsic and correspondent of the French
Institute, in presence of Professors Fechner,
Braune, Weber, Scheibner, and the
celebrated surgeon, Thiersch. It was with
Slade, an American medium as extraordinary
as Home, that Zoellner experimented.
These experiments may be thus briefly
mentioned:</p>

<p>1. Movements made by psychic force,
through the medium of Slade, of a magnet
enclosed in a compass box.</p>

<p>2. Blows struck on a table, a knife
raised in air, without contact, to the height
of a foot.</p>

<p>3. Movement of heavy bodies. Zoellner’s
bed was drawn two feet from the
wall, Slade remaining seated with his back
to the bed, his legs covered and in full
view of the experimenters.</p>

<p>4. A fire-screen broken with noise, without
contact with the medium, and the fragments
thrown five feet.</p>

<p>5. Writing produced on several experimental
occasions between two slates
belonging to Zoellner, and held well in
view.</p>

<p>6. Magnetization of a steel needle.</p>

<p>7. Acid reaction given to neutral substances.</p>

<p>8. Imprints of hands and naked feet on
smoked surfaces or surfaces powdered with
flour, which did not correspond with the
hands and feet of the medium, who remained
meantime in full view of the experimenters,
while Slade’s feet were covered
with shoes.</p>

<p>9. Knots tied in bands of copper sealed
at both ends and held in the hands of
Slade and Zoellner, etc.</p>

<p>We find the same tests and facts observed
by Mr. Crookes and the French
experimenters, who, following his example,
have sought to account for <i>Psychic Force</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>67</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class II.</span>—<i>Phenomenon of percussion
and other analogous noises.</i></p>

<p>The popular name of <i>spiritual rapping</i>
gives a very poor idea of this class of phenomena.
On different occasions during
his experiments, Mr. Crookes heard blows
of a delicate variety, such as might be produced
by the point of a needle; a cascade
of sounds, as acute as those coming from
an induction coil in full activity; sharp
blows or detonations in the air; acute
notes of a metallic variety; rasping sounds
similar to that heard from a machine with
rubbing action; noises like scratching;
twittering chirps like a bird, etc.</p>

<p>“I have observed these noises,” says
Crookes, “with the majority of mediums,
each of whom has a special peculiarity.
They were more varied with Mr. Home;
but, for force and certainty of result, I
have never met a medium who approached
Kate Fox. For several months I experimented,
it may be said, in an unlimited
manner, and verified the different manifestations
induced by the presence of this
lady, and I especially examined the phenomenon
relative to these noises.</p>

<p>“With mediums, it is necessary in
general that they be methodically seated
for the <i>seance</i> before noises are heard, but
with Miss Kate Fox it was sufficient to
merely place her hand on any object, no
matter what, and violent blows were heard,
like a triple sound of beating, and sometimes
so loud as to be heard at different
pieces of furniture in the room.</p>

<p>“In this manner, I have heard these
noises on a living tree, on a fragment of
glass, on a membrane extended in a frame—for
instance, a tambourine—on the top
of a cab, and on the edge of the parquet
railing in the theatre.</p>

<p>“However, effective contact is not always
necessary. I have heard the noise sound
inside walls, when the hands and feet of
the medium were tightly held; when Miss
Fox was seated in a chair; when she was
suspended above the platform; finally,
when she had fallen on a sofa in a dead
faint.</p>

<p>“I have heard these same noises on
the harmonica; I have felt them on my
shoulder and under my hands; I have
heard them on a leaf of paper held between
the fingers by the aid of a wire passed
through one corner.</p>

<p>“With a perfect knowledge of the
numerous theories advanced, in America
principally, to explain these knocks or
spirit rapping, I have verified them by all
methods I could imagine, so that I have
acquired a positive conviction as their objective
reality, and the absolute certainty
that it was impossible to produce these
sounds by artifice or some mechanical
means.</p>

<p>“An important question is here asked
that deserves attention, <i>i.e.</i> ‘<i>are these noises
governed by an intelligence?</i>’<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>“From the commencement of my investigations,
I have recognized the fact that
the power which produced the phenomena,
was not simply a fluid force, but that <i>it is
associated with an intelligence, or follows its
directions</i>.”</p>

<p>During the three years that I have
experimented in psychology with Dr.
Puel and his friends, there has been no
<i>seance</i> where we have not been able to
determine more or less important phenomena
of percussion. An experiment I
love to make is that of striking my fingers
on the table, either to imitate the music of
a band with drum accompaniment with
some known air, and the same sound is
immediately produced on the under surface
of the piece of furniture, with the same
rhythm appearing to be invoked by an
invisible hand performing under the table.
This phenomenon is manifested sometimes
spontaneously upon my demand or that of
my assistant. I observed it one evening at
my own house for more than a quarter of
an hour from, the moment I entered the
room; in this case the noise was a rolling,
which appeared to arise from the metallic
surface of a table. It was a member of
my family who called my attention to the
abnormal noise, so much the more curious,
inasmuch as I could produce it at will,
giving shades and variations expressed by
the movements of my hand. In order to
respond in advance to any objection, I will
say it was two o’clock in the morning when
this phenomenon was produced, and there
was no passing carriages in the street to
make any kind of a vibration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>68</span></p>

<p>These phenomena of percussion are
sometimes produced with a most extraordinary
intensity, as in the observations of
Kate Fox in the house at Hydesville;
these were probably only phenomena of
percussion similar to those observed at
Louviers, in the home of Madame Gay,
under the mediumship of Francoise Fontaine,
in 1591, manifestations which were
then attributed to the Devil, or later to a
condition of hallucinations, among the
witnesses, according to the <i>materialistic
psychologists</i> of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class III.</span>—<i>Alteration of the weight of
bodies.</i></p>

<p>The experiments made by Mr. Crookes,
in regard to the alterations in the weight of
bodies, enters the category of psychic
phenomena examined with the most mathematical
exactitude, by the aid of accurate
registering apparatus. It is in these
experiments that the celebrated English
physician was able to witness <i>Psychic Force</i>
developed by his <i>medium</i>.</p>

<p>The description and designs of the
apparatus thus used may be found in
the “<i>Moniteur de la Policlinique</i>,” of the
7th and 14th of May, 1882, and in “<i>Le
Spiritisme</i>” of Dr. Paul Gibier, published
in the year 1887.</p>

<p>This article is too lengthy for reproduction
in this work, but we have the right to
consider it as the point of departure for
experimental psychology, for not only have
they not been denied in France and other
countries, but <i>they have been recognized as
absolutely true</i>, by several colleagues of Mr.
Crookes, belonging to the <i>Royal Society of
London</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class IV.</span>—<i>Movements of heavy bodies
at a distance from the medium.</i></p>

<p>“There are numerous instances in
which heavy objects, such as tables, chairs,
ropes, etc., have been moved when the
medium never touched them. I will mention
a few striking cases.</p>

<p>“My own chair turned half way around
while my feet were on the floor.</p>

<p>“In full view of all the people present,
a chair started from a far off corner and
advanced slowly to a table while we were
watching its movement.</p>

<p>“On another occasion an arm chair
came from to the place we were seated,
and then, on my demand, slowly returned
backward a distance of three feet.</p>

<p>“During three consecutive <i>seances</i>, a
small table crossed the room under
conditions I had especially fixed in advance,
in order to respond victoriously to all
objections that might possibly be raised
against the reality of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>“I repeated on several occasions the
experiment considered as conclusive by the
“<i>Dialectic Society</i>,” that is to say, the
movement of a heavy table in a full glare
of light, the backs of chairs being turned
towards the table about one foot of distance,
each person being in a kneeling
posture upon his chair, the hands placed
upon the back above the table, but not
touching it.</p>

<p>“On one of these occasions, the
experiment took place while I walked all
around the table in order to see how each
person was placed.” (<i>Crookes</i>).</p>

<p>In our own seances, with Madam
Rosine, L.B., we have seen, ten or twelve
times at least, a small table on rollers,
advance towards us as though moved by a
force of attraction or repulsion.</p>

<p>A similar phenomenon was very often
produced in my office, under the mediumistic
influences of M. D. with a strength
of extraordinary propulsion, which seemed
to originate in brute force. The traces of
violent shocks of a table against my bureau
still remain to testify to the results of this
occurrence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class V.</span>—<i>Chairs and tables raised from
the earth without contact with any person.</i></p>

<p>“A remark usually made when cases
of this kind arise is: ‘Why do these things
only occur with chairs and tables? Is this
a privilege solely enjoyed by pieces of
furniture?’ I wish to answer this by
stating that I simply observed facts and
report them without pretending to enter
into the <i>why</i> and <i>how</i>; but, in truth, it is
very evident that if any inanimate object
of a certain weight can be lifted from the
earth in the ordinary dining room, it could
as easily be anything else than a chair or
table.</p>

<p>“That such phenomena are not limited
to furniture I have numerous proofs, as
have other experimenters; the <i>intelligence</i>
or <i>force</i>, whichever it may be, that produces
the manifestations, can only operate with
materials that are at its disposition.</p>

<p>“On five distinct occasions a heavy
dining table was raised from the floor for a
height varying from some inches to a foot
and a half, under special imposed conditions
that made fraud impossible.</p>

<p>“On another occasion a heavy table<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>69</span>
was raised to the ceiling, in full light,
<i>while I held the feet and hands of the
medium</i>.</p>

<p>“At another time the table raised itself
above the floor, without any one touching
it, but under conditions I had previously
imposed in such a manner as to render the
proof of the fact incontestable.” (<i>Crookes.</i>)</p>

<p>The phenomena observed in this class
of experiments belong to those of <i>movement
without contact</i>. Although these are difficult
to obtain, I have noticed them several
times; I have seen, in my own home, a
massive table raised some distance from
the floor ten or fifteen seconds after all
contact had ceased. Dr. Gibier had the
advantage of obtaining complete levitation
and seeing the table <i>turn and touch the ceiling
with its four feet</i>, under the mediumistic
influence of Mr. Slade. The Doctor
affirms this fact in his own book on the
subject.</p>

<p>In the trial of August 31st, 1591, a
phenomenon similar to the one narrated
befell Francoise Fontaine, <i>i.e.</i>, the fall of an
iron door on the unfortunate girl; the elevation
in the air of a washtub and its
being emptied in the presence of the jailer
and the prisoner Aufrenille. Francois
Fontaine was evidently a <i>medium</i> with
<i>psychic effects</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class VI.</span>—<i>Raising human beings in the
air.</i></p>

<p>“This phenomenon has taken place in
my presence four times, although in obscurity.
The conditions under which these
movements were performed, however,
were completely satisfactory; but the ocular
demonstration of such a thing is necessary
to prevent the effects of our preconceived
opinions; for example, upon that
which is <i>naturally possible or impossible</i>, I
shall only mention here cases in which the
deductions of reason have been affirmed
by the sense of vision.</p>

<p>“I saw, one day, in the quality of
spectator, a chair on which a lady was
seated raised from the floor several inches.</p>

<p>“On another occasion, in order to
avoid being suspected of producing the
phenomenon by artificial means, the lady
knelt on the chair, so that the four legs of
the piece of furniture were visible to every
eye; then the chair was lifted from the
floor three inches, remaining suspended in
the air for ten seconds, when it slowly descended
to the floor again.</p>

<p>“Another time, but separately, two
children were raised to the ceiling in their
chairs, under a full glare of light, under
conditions entirely satisfactory to me, for I
was on my knees and attentively watched
the feet of the chairs in order to see that
no one touched them.</p>

<p>“The most remarkable examples of
levitation I have observed have taken
place with Mr. Home. On three occasions
I have seen him lifted to the ceiling of the
room. On the first occasion he was seated
in a chair, the second time he was kneeling
on a chair, and the third experiment
he stood on the chair. In all these instances
I had every facility for examining
the phenomena at the moment they occurred.</p>

<p>“Over a hundred instances where Mr.
Home was raised from the floor in the
presence of numerous witnesses have been
published, and I have had the oral testimony
of at least three witnesses to these
exhibitions, <i>i.e.</i>, Count Dunraven, Lord
Lindsay, and Captain Wynne.</p>

<p>“To reject the numerous depositions presented
on this subject would be to reject all
human testimony on any other subject; for
there are no facts in history, be they sacred
or profane, that are supported on such a
solid basis of proof.</p>

<p>“The number of witnesses who will
testify to the levitations of Mr. Home is
overwhelming. It is to be greatly desired
that persons whose testimony would be
accepted as conclusive by the scientific
world would seriously examine with patience
these facts.</p>

<p>“The majority of ocular witnesses of
these phenomena are still living, and will
most assuredly bear witness; but in a few
years it will be difficult, if not impossible,
to obtain such <i>direct evidence</i> as in the case
of Home.” (<i>Crookes.</i>)</p>

<p>It is to this class of phenomena that the
case of Francois Fontaine belongs, the
authenticated facts of which, officially recorded
and witnessed, are matters of history;
her levitations in the prison at
Louviers cannot be doubted.</p>

<p>The cataleptic symptoms accompanying
the ascentional movements of this
woman bear witness as to the special
neuropathic condition in which she was
found—a condition to-day in which most
mediums develop <i>psychic force</i>, either spontaneously
or following hypnotic maneuvers.</p>

<p>One of the benefits to future science<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>70</span>
will be the explanation given to these phenomena
now considered supernatural;
things that our learned Academicians
refuse to believe in, <i>although not investigating</i>,
insisting that such phenomena are
hallucinations, the mere assertions of
writers and those who witness them; while
these so-called <i>savants</i>, who laugh spiritualism
to scorn, claiming it a fraud and imposture,
are themselves afraid to be convinced
by scientific experimentation.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class VII.</span>—<i>Movement of small objects
without personal contact.</i></p>

<p>“Under this title I propose to describe
certain particular phenomena of which I
have been a witness.</p>

<p>“I shall content myself to here allude
to some facts all the more surprising, since
those who have witnessed them did so
under circumstances that rendered all deception
impossible; it would be foolish to
attribute these results to fraud, for the phenomena
were not observed in the house of
a medium, but in my own home, where
any previous preparation was out of the
question.</p>

<p>“A medium was taken to my dressing
room and seated in a certain portion of the
chamber under the watchful eyes of a
number of attentive witnesses, and played
an accordion <i>I held in my own hand</i> with
the keys upside down; this same accordion
then floated in the air, playing as
it remained suspended.</p>

<p>“This medium could not secretly introduce
to my home a machine strong enough
to rattle my windows and remove Venetian
blinds to the distance of eight feet; to
tie knots in my handkerchief and carry it
to a far-off corner of a large room; to play
notes on a piano at a distance; to make a
plate float around the room; to raise a
water carafe from a table; to make a coral
necklace stand up on one of its limber extremities;
to put a fan in the usual society
motions; or to start the pendulum of a
clock when the time piece was sealed
in glass and screwed tightly to the wall.”
(<i>Crookes.</i>)</p>

<p>These same phenomena are produced
by Fakirs. A certain number of fig or
other leaves are perforated by bamboo
sticks stuck in the ground. The charmer
extends his hands, the leaves move up along
the long sticks on which they are strung.</p>

<p>Another experiment: a vase is filled
with water and spontaneously moves over
a table, leans, oscillates, is raised a perceptible
height, without a drop of water being
spilled.</p>

<p>Musical instruments render sounds,
play melodious airs, under the eyes of the
investigator, at some distance from the
Fakir and without the latter making any
apparent movement. Dr. Gibier cites
these phenomena, witnessed by persons
entitled to every confidence.</p>

<p>During seances at the home of my
friend Dr. Fuel, with Madam L. B., we
have witnessed similar phenomena. Several
times my <i>confrere</i> and I have seen
damask curtains at his office windows
shake and open; have heard the sound of
a small trumpet placed in the center of a
table, in the dark, it is true, but we were
holding each other’s hands in the circle
and used all possible precautions not to be
duped or humbugged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class VIII.</span>—<i>Luminous apparitions.</i></p>

<p>“These manifestations are weak and
generally require a darkened room. I wish
to recall to my readers the fact that on
these occasions I have taken all the necessary
precautions to avoid being deceived
by light due to luminous oils (of which
phosphorous might form the basis) or other
means. Besides, I have endeavored in
vain to imitate these lights artificially.</p>

<p>“I have seen under experimental conditions
of the most severe sort, a solid
body having its own light about the size of a
goose egg float around the room without
noise at a height not to be touched even
by standing on ones toes, afterwards softly
descend to the floor.</p>

<p>“This luminous globe remained visible
for more than ten minutes before disappearing;
it struck the table on three occasions,
making the noise produced by any
hard and solid body of the same size.</p>

<p>“During this time, the medium was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>71</span>
seated in an arm chair, in an apparent
condition of insensibility.</p>

<p>“I have seen luminous sparks disport
themselves above the heads of various persons.</p>

<p>“I have obtained response to questions
by means of flashes of light, any number
of times in front of my own face.</p>

<p>“I have seen sparks of light rise from
the table and to the ceiling and fall back on
the table with a distinct noise of solidity.</p>

<p>“I have obtained, alphabetically, a
communication, by means of flashes of
light, produced in mid air, before my eyes,
while my hand moved around in the rays
of the communicating light; I have seen a
luminous cloud float up and rest on a picture.</p>

<p>“On several occasions, under similar
conditions of severe control, a body solid
in appearance but crystalline, having a
light of its own, has been placed in my
hand by a hand not belonging to any person
present in the room. In <i>the full glare
of light</i>, I have seen a luminous body fly to
the top of a heliotrope placed on top of a
<i>console</i>, break off a small branch of the
plant and carry it to the hand of a lady
present.</p>

<p>“I have sometimes seen similar luminous
clouds <i>visibly condense, assume the form
of a hand</i>, and carry small articles to people,
but these phenomena properly belong
to another class of manifestations.” (<i>Crookes</i>).</p>

<p>The only phenomena of this nature that
I have noticed were produced under the
following circumstances: One evening,
after commencing some experiments with
Madam L. B., in the parlor of Dr. Puel,
we were obliged to cut the <i>seance</i> short
owing to a convulsive hysterical attack
that overcame the medium—an attack
which lasted more than an hour and which
was only stopped by the application of
metallic plates to the thorax. Having regained
consciousness, the lady, with her
husband and Dr. Puel, retired to the latter’s
consultation office, where I was summoned
a few moments later by my <i>confrere</i>.
Madam L. B. was standing, supported by
my two friends,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> while from her chest
arose phosphorescent vapors, which grew
more dense and thick as the lights in the
room were turned down. These phenomena
lasted more than a quarter of an hour,
during which Madam L. B. uttered long
and painful groans. These vapors had the
odor of phosphorus, and seemed to rise
from the epigastric region.</p>

<p>I was called some months later to
attend to Madam L. B., whom I found in a
condition of profound anæmia and mental
prostration, reminding me of the <i>seance</i>; I
prescribed granules of phosphoric acid for
her with excellent results.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class IX.</span>—<i>Apparition of hands, either
luminous or visible under ordinary light.</i></p>

<p>“One finds himself frequently touched
by hands, or something having the form of
hands, during <i>dark seances</i>, or under circumstances
which do not permit us to see
these forms; but <i>I have seen these hands</i>.</p>

<p>“I shall not speak here of instances in
which the phenomenon occurred in obscurity,
but will simply choose some of the
<i>numerous instances</i> in which I have seen the
hands <i>in the light</i>.</p>

<p>“A small hand, of charming shape,
has risen from the table and extended me
a flower; this hand appeared and disappeared
three times at intervals and gave
me every opportunity to convince myself
that it was, in appearance, as real as my
own. This occurred in a full light, in my
own room, while I held the hands and feet
of the medium.</p>

<p>“On another occasion, a small hand
and arm, similar to those of a child, appeared
to play around a lady seated near
me; this arm floated to my side, struck
my arm lightly and pulled my coat several
times.</p>

<p>“Another time, I saw an arm and
hand tear the petals from a flower placed
in Mr. Home’s <i>boutonniere</i> and hold the
same before the faces of parties sitting near
him.</p>

<p>“On this occasion, and with other witnesses,
who saw the same manifestations, a
hand touched the keys of an accordeon
and played the instrument, while the
medium’s hands were visible meantime,
and even held at times by persons seated
near him.</p>

<p>“The hands and fingers have always
appeared solid and like those of any living
person; at times, however, they appeared
nebular, condensations in the form of
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>72</span></p>

<p>“These phenomena were not visible to
the same extent to all the persons present.
For example, one person would see a
flower or other small object; another person
would see a small cloud of luminosity
fly over the flower; another, still, would
notice a nebulous hand; while others,
again, would simply see the movement of
the flower.</p>

<p>“I have seen, on several occasions, an
object move with the appearance of a
luminous cloud and perfectly condense
into the form of a hand; under such circumstances
the hand is visible to all persons
present.</p>

<p>“It is not always a simple form, for
often the hand perfectly resembles that of
a living person, and has every element of
grace; the fingers move; the flesh presents
a human appearance, the same as though
that of a living person; at the wrist or arm
this form may become nebulous, and end
in a luminous cloud of vapor.</p>

<p>“To the touch the hand appears cold,
icy as in death at times; while on other
occasions it feels warm and living, clasping
my hand like that of an old friend would.</p>

<p>“I have retained one of these hands in
mine, <i>firmly resolved not to let it escape</i>; it
made no resistance nor effort to disengage
itself, but appeared to gradually resolve
itself into vapor.” (<i>Crookes</i>).</p>

<p>I have heard many persons affirm that
they perceived hands that touched them in
<i>full light</i>. I never had this experience, but
I can testify that during eight or ten sittings
I and five or six persons who assisted
me felt these hands perfectly; and among
these hands were those belonging to a
small child, and <i>certainly</i> no small child
was in the house; these baby hands were
soothing and caressing. Our medium was
still Madam L. B., who, during the <i>seance</i>,
was held down tightly on a sofa by Madam
P., whose scrupulous attention may be relied
on where <i>science</i> is at stake, for all our
experimentations of this sort were in the
dark. Several times the small baby hands
were put in my sleeve, and seemed to take
pleasure in pulling off my cuffs and taking
them to other persons in the room. My
eyeglass was also taken by the infantile
fingers and carried to one of the circle.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class X.</span>—<i>Direct writing.</i></p>

<p>This is the expression we employ to
designate a writing not produced by any
person present, and Mr. Crookes gives the
following description of this phenomenon:</p>

<p>“I have often received words and
messages written on paper (on which I had
made private marks) under the most severe
conditions of control; and I have heard,
in the dark, the noise of the pencil moving
across the paper. The precautions previously
taken by me were so strict that my
mind is perfectly convinced, as if the characters
of the writing were formed under
my own eyes.</p>

<p>“But, as space will not permit me to
enter into complete details, I shall simply
choose two cases in which my eyes as well
as my ears were witnesses of the operation.</p>

<p>“The first case I shall cite took place,
it is true, in <i>dark seance</i>, but the result was
none the less satisfactory.</p>

<p>“I was seated near the medium, Miss
Fox, and there were only two persons
present, my wife and a relative of ours; I
held both hands of the medium in one of
mine, while her feet were on top of my
own. There was paper before us on the
table and my hand held the pencil.</p>

<p>“A luminous hand descended from
above, and, after hovering near me for a
few seconds, took the pencil from my hand,
writing rapidly on the paper, threw the
pencil over our heads and gradually faded
in obscurity.</p>

<p>“The second case may be considered
and registered as a discovery. A good
discovery is often more convincing than
the most successful experiment.</p>

<p>“This occurred in the light of my own
room, in the presence of Mr. Home and a
few friends. Different circumstances, unnecessary
to enumerate here, had shown
that evening that <i>the psychic power was very
strong</i>. I expressed the desire of witnessing
the production of a real written message,
similar to that I had one of my friends
mention a short time before. At the
instant this wish was uttered an alphabetical
communication was given which read,
‘<i>We will try</i>.’</p>

<p>“A pencil and some sheets of paper
were placed on the center of the table.
Soon <i>the pencil stood on its point and advanced</i>,
by jerks, then fell over. It raised
itself again and fell over; it tried a third
time but with no better result.</p>

<p>“After three fruitless attempts, a small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>73</span>
piece of wood which laid near on the table
slid towards the pencil and raised itself
some inches above the table. The pencil
now raised itself anew, supporting itself
against the wood, and the two made an
effort to write on the paper; this did not
succeed and a new trial was made. On
the third attempt the wooden lath abandoned
its efforts and fell back to its old
position on the table; the pencil remained
in the position where it fell on the paper,
and an alphabetical message said to us,
“<i>We have tried to do what you have asked,
but our power is exhausted</i>.” (Crookes.)</p>

<p>In India, the Fakirs easily obtain
direct writing; they spread fine sand on a
table or other smooth surface and place on
this sand a small pointed stick made of
wood. At a given moment this stick rises
and traces characters on the sand, which
are responses to questions put by the
lookers on.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>In the experiments made with our
friend Dr. Puel, we obtained writing on
over twenty slates. A bit of chalk was
placed on a new slate and this slate was
placed on a table at some distance from
the medium, Madam L. B., the experiments
being made with all the cautions
possible. A previous examination of both
surfaces of the slate put away all doubts as
to any fraud in that respect. I, meantime,
held the hands of Madame L. B., the
medium, who was always in a hypnotic
condition during such experiments, at
which several persons usually assisted—persons
who were known to be capable of
observing and recording facts with coolness
and deliberation.</p>

<p>All these communications have a signature,
and many of them date 1900 as the
epoch when <i>modern spiritualism</i> shall be
scientifically recognized by the world.</p>

<p>Dr. Gibier, who made interesting experiments
with Mr. Slade, like us, obtained
spontaneous writing on many slates, of
which he gives reproductions in his remarkable
work, <i>a book that he had the courage
to write and to which his celebrated name
is affixed</i>.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>We do not find in any Middle Age
documents such spontaneously written
communications; at least Demonographers
do not mention them in their writings, for
if they had it would have been a most
striking proof of the analogy of magic
with modern spiritualism and Indian Fakirism,
which serves as an intermediary in the
history of Occultism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class XI.</span>—<i>Forms and figures of phantoms.</i></p>

<p>“These phenomena are rarely ever witnessed.
The conditions required for their
appearance seeming so delicate, and so
little prevents their production, that it is
only on very few occasions that I have witnessed
satisfactory results. I will cite two
cases:</p>

<p>“At twilight, in a <i>seance</i> by Mr. Home,
given at a private house, the blinds of a
window, back of the medium about eight
feet, were seen to move, then all the persons
sitting near the window perceived a
shadowy form that grew darker and then
semi-transparent, like that of a man trying
the shutters with his hand. While we
gazed at this object in the twilight it
evanesced and the window shutters ceased
to move.</p>

<p>“The following example is still more
striking. As in the preceding case Mr.
Home was the medium. A phantom form
came from the corner of the room, took an
accordeon in its hand, and glided around
the room playing the instrument beautifully.
This phantom was visible to all
those present for the space of several
minutes, Mr. Home being perfectly visible
at the same time. Then this shade approached
a lady in the room, when the
frightened woman uttered a scream and
the phantom vanished.” (<i>Crookes.</i>)</p>

<p>We regret that space will not permit
our giving the experiments made on Miss
Cook and Katie King, spectres which became
so tangible that they were photographed.</p>

<p>This History given by Crookes regarding
spiritual photography is well nigh incredible,
but Dr. Crookes has remarked
concerning doubters and his personal experiments,
“<i>I do not say that it is possible,
I say that it is</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>74</span></p>

<p>These apparitions of forms and figures
of phantoms were more common to the
Middle Ages than at the present day, if
we are to believe the numerous cases cited
by Pierre Le Loyer.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>This celebrated author in fact, will not
admit that there is any doubt on this subject;
a matter he has thoroughly studied,
for he says in this preface of his
work—“<i>Aussi est traicte des extases et rauissements:
de l’essence, nature et origine des
Ames, et de leur estat apres le deces de leurs
corps; plus des Magiciens et Sorciers, de leur
communication avec les malins esprits; ensemble
des remedes pour se preseruer des illusions et
impostures diaboliques</i>.”</p>

<p>In analyzing passages from this curious
document, we will immediately see
the correlation that exists between what
was called in other times sorcery or magic,
and spiritualism. In speaking of these
spectres which form in the air, and under
our eyes, Pierre Le Loyer writes: “We
know them by the coldness of their touch
and their bodies, which are soft, their
hands receding from ours like soft cotton
when pressed, or a snow-ball squeezed in a
child’s hand. They tarry no longer than
it pleases them, returning again into their
element.”</p>

<p>Further along, Le Loyer adds: “A
bad spirit questioned by a sorcerer why
his body was not warm, responded that it
was not in his power to give it heat.”</p>

<p>But, meantime, he attributed these apparitions
to evil spirits and demons; finally,
our author seeks to explain “what is this
body seen and touched of these demons,
so to speak, of the air, water and earth?”</p>

<p>“These devils appear indifferently to
all persons; they themselves affect the
society of certain, individuals some much
more than others.”</p>

<p>“To these sorcerers and witches
(<i>mediums</i>), they ordinarily show themselves
in a visible form, and will come to those
who call them.”</p>

<p>“As to persons subject to these sort of
things, they are usually those young and
tender of age, cold and imperfectly organized
beings; by such we can speak with
power; old men and eunuchs, and withal
melancholy persons.”</p>

<p>“All those these devils dominate over,
are estranged from their natural, beings,
and not infrequently become maniacs.”</p>

<p>Our author in his chapter on the essence
of souls, affirms, that “that the ancient
oracles <i>were only the Oracles of the souls of
men</i>,” and to be specific, he gives a long
list of names. He remarks, “there were
in Greece, temples known to be psychomantic,
and in such places were received
responses from the souls of different men.
It was for this reason too, that the souls
for the same reason watched over the
places where the bodies of generous and
noble barons had been burned.”</p>

<p>Further along Le Loyer mentions the
origin of the <i>power that the spirits possess of
manifesting themselves to us</i>, but our author
<i>disagrees with the modern theories that makes
them derive their power from the medium</i>, for
he remarks that the spirits can act “<i>through
their own powers</i>,” and are governed only
by their own intelligence. “They are not
off so far,” adds he, “and the distance between
us and the spirits is so slight that we
may easily communicate;” however, he
says, meantime: “They are commanded
by God and conform to his will.”</p>

<p>Finally, he considers man as an inferior
being to the spirits of the dead—in
fact, he states: “The soul appears to derive
nothing from another, and, as an invisible
spirit, it acts with us as a passive
agent, being too proud to control that
which is inferior; and I deny,” says he,
“that the true souls of the dead obey
either charms or magical words.”</p>

<p>Of the future of the soul after death he
remarks to one of his opponents, whose
opinions he refuted, that “<i>this soul, whatever
it may be, in a state of health or not
purged, comes by degrees and not at one bound
into the full fruition and happiness of God</i>;”
and these degrees, according to Le Loyer,
are like prisons where the penalties for
misdeeds done in the flesh are to be satisfied.
He admits, however, that some
spirits make more rapid progress than
others. These, to his mind, are the judgments
of God after death, and the fire
mentioned in Scriptures. Such is the manner
in which he explains away the ideas of
the images of Paradise and Hell, the promises
to the virtuous and the wicked. He
cites (<i>apropos</i> of manifestations before
courts of justice) houses “where spirits
have appeared and made all manner of
noises, that disturbed the tenants at night.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>75</span>
He speaks of Daniel and Nicholas Macquereau,
who rented a house for a term of
years. “They had been living there but
a short time when they heard the noises
and hubbub made by invisible spirits, who
allowed them neither sleep nor repose.”
The court cancelled the lease, thus <i>admitting
that there were places haunted by
spirits</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class XII.</span>—<i>Particular examples which
seem to indicate the intervention of a superior
intelligence.</i></p>

<p>“It has already been demonstrated that
these phenomena are governed by an Intelligence;
an important question is to know
what is the source of this Intelligence.</p>

<p>“Is this the Intelligence of the <i>medium</i>
or some one else present in the room? Or
is this Intelligence exterior? I do not wish
to commit myself on this point at present in
a positive manner. I will say that I have
observed several circumstances which appeared
to demonstrate that the will and the
intelligence of the medium have a great influence
on the phenomena. I have likewise
observed others which seemed to
prove in a conclusive manner the intervention
of an intelligence entirely independent
of all persons found in the room
where the <i>seance</i> was given.</p>

<p>“Space will not permit me to give
here all the arguments that might serve to
prove these propositions, but I will briefly
mention one or two circumstances chosen
from among a number of others. I have
several times seen phenomena take place
simultaneously, some of them being unknown
to the medium. I have seen Miss
Fox write automatically a message for a
person present, while a message for another
person was given alphabetically by means
of <i>raps</i>, and during all the time of these
manifestations she conversed on a subject
entirely different from the two others.</p>

<p>“The following case is, perhaps, still
more astonishing. During a <i>seance</i> with
Mr. Home, a small wooden lath, that I
have previously mentioned, came across the
table to me, in full light, and gave me a
message by striking lightly on my hand;
I repeated the alphabet and the lath struck
me at the proper letters; the other end of
this wooden stick was some distance off
from the hands of Mr. Home.</p>

<p>“The blows were so distinct and clear,
the wooden lath was so evidently under
the invisible power that governed its movements,
that I said: ‘Can the intelligence
that governs the movements of this lath
change the character of the movement and
give me a telegraphic message by means of
the Morse alphabet, by blows struck on
my hand?’</p>

<p>“I had every reason for thinking that
the Morse alphabet was entirely unknown
to all the other persons present, and I
knew it only imperfectly myself.</p>

<p>“Immediately after I had said this the
character of the raps changed and the message
was continued in the manner I demanded.
The letters were given too
rapidly for me to catch but a word now
and then, consequently I lost the message;
but I had heard sufficient to convince me
that there was a good Morse operator at
the other extremity of the line, no matter
what place it might be in.</p>

<p>“Another example: A lady wrote
automatically by the aid of Planchette.
I sought to discover the means to prove
what she wrote was not due to <i>unconscious
cerebration</i>. Planchette, as it always does,
affirmed that, although the movements
were made by the hands and arms of the
operator, there was an intelligence coming
from an invisible being, who played on her
brain like an instrument of music and thus
put her muscles in motion.</p>

<p>“I then remarked to this Intelligence,
‘Can you see what is contained in this
chamber?’ And Planchette answered,
‘Yes.’ ‘Can you read this journal?‘ said
I, placing my finger on a copy of the <i>London
Times</i> that happened to be back of me
on a table, but which I could not see.
‘Yes’ responded Planchette. ‘Very well,’
said I, ‘write the word now covered by
my finger.’ Planchette commenced to
move and the word ‘however’ was slowly
written. I turned around and saw that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>76</span>
word ‘however’ was covered by the end
of my finger. I had not looked at the
paper when I attempted this experiment,
and it was impossible for the lady, had she
tried, to see any word in the journal, as
she was seated at a table and the <i>London
Times</i> lay on a table back of me with my
body interposed.” (<i>Crookes.</i>)</p>

<p>In the experiments in typtology at
which I have assisted, to all the demands
addressed to <i>psychic force</i> the responses have
always presented a particular character
independent of that of the assistants.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>I have sometimes tried to concentrate
my will upon the answer awaited, and
have always failed in my attempts at mental
pressure.</p>

<p>1 have likewise determined that these
answers cannot be dictated by the mind of
the medium, whose scientific and literary
knowledge were not always equal to the
message received. This observation coincides
with the facts observed among pretended
Demonomaniacs, who had in their
attacks the gift of language, responding in
Latin to the exorcists, making entire discourses
in this language, of which they
knew not the first elements.</p>

<p>Under the name of <i>phenomena of ecstasy</i>,
Dr. Gibier described, after his experiments
with the medium Slade, his displacement
by a stronger spirit to that of his usual
control. Says Gibier, the phenomena produced
from thence were “a certain discoloration
of the medium’s face, which
became red, a sort of grin contracting the
muscles of the visage, the eyes were convulsed
upwards, and after some nystagmatic
movements of the ball of the eye the
eyelids closed tightly, gritting of the
medium’s teeth was heard, and a convulsive
sign, indicating the commencement of
his <i>possession</i> by a strange spirit. After this
short phase, which was painful to behold,
the medium’s face fell into a smile and the
voice, as well as the attitude, was completely
modified to that of a different person.
Slade thus transformed to his regular
control, saluted all our party most
graciously.”</p>

<p>Among the experiments made by Dr.
Gibier to control this condition of <i>incarnation</i>
(the English call it <i>trance</i>), we might
cite that of a comparison of the dynamometric
force of the medium in his natural
condition and the <i>trance</i> state. In the first
case, by reason of two previous attacks of
hemiplegia, Slade’s muscular force gave 27
kilos to the right and 35 kilos to the left.
In the second state there were 63 kilos to
the right and 50 kilos to the left. Meantime,
Dr. Gibier, no more than ourselves,
deems it proper to consider the trance state
other than a hypothesis, “a foreign element,
introduced in the scene, and like it
present in the experiences of suggestion
and catalepsy.”</p>

<p>If we cannot give a scientific explanation
of these phenomena, it is our duty to
examine them as others and retrace their
history, especially seeking those points of
coincidence with the proofs furnished by
the history of demonomania and diabolic
possession of the Middle Ages; for we are
convinced that these phenomena were
dominated by the same unknown force,
interpreted differently by reason of the
philosophic and religious ideas of the
epoch at which they were studied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Class XIII.</span>—<i>Varied cases of a complex
character.</i></p>

<p>Under this title Mr. Crookes cites facts
that cannot be classed otherwise by reason
of their complex character. As an example,
he reports two cases: one being an
experiment in typtology between himself,
Miss Fox, and another lady. He proved
that a bell that belonged in his business
office was brought to the table, as a proof
announced by the intellectual force, that
communicated with him, <i>of its strength</i>.
The chamber in which this was done was
separated from the office by a door which
he previously securely locked with a key,
and he was absolutely positive that the bell
in question was in his office.</p>

<p>“The second case I desire to report,”
says Mr. Crookes, “took place one Saturday
night under a full glare of light, Mr.
Home and my family being the only persons
present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>77</span></p>

<p>“My wife and I, having passed the
day in the country, had brought home
flowers with us that I had gathered; on
arriving at home we had given them to a
servant to put in water. Mr. Home came
shortly after and we went into the dining
room. At the instant we seated ourselves,
the domestic brought the flowers, arranged
in a vase; I placed them in the center of
the table, which was not covered by a
cloth. It was the first time Mr. Home
had seen these flowers.</p>

<p>“Immediately a message came, given
by the rap alphabet, which said, ‘It is impossible
for matter to pass through matter,
but we will show you that we can do it.’
We waited in silence, and soon a luminous
apparition was seen floating over the
bouquet of flowers, and then, in full view of
all my family at the table, a branch of
China grass, fifteen inches in length,
which ornamented the middle of the
bouquet, slowly rose from the bunch of
flowers, descended from the vase and
moved across the table, and my wife saw a
hand stretched out from under the table and
seize the flower; at the same moment she
was struck three times on the left shoulder
and the noise made by the slaps was so
loud we all heard it; then the luminous
hand dropped the China grass to the floor
and disappeared. Only two persons of my
family saw the hand, but every one at the
table noticed the different movements of
the plant stalk, as I have before described
them.</p>

<p>“During the time that this phenomena
lasted we all saw Mr. Home’s hands on the
table, where they rested motionless, and
they were at least eighteen inches from
where the plant stalk disappeared.</p>

<p>“It was a dining-room table that
opened in folds, it did not lengthen,” etc.</p>

<p>As a contribution to the facts mentioned
in this class, I may report the
famous experiments with the bracelet made
by Dr. Puel—experiments that I have witnessed
a dozen times at least—as well as
numerous other persons. A bracelet made
of brass, without opening or solder, cut by
a machine out of a solid piece of metal,
was placed on the forearm of Madame L.
B. The lady’s hands rested flat on the
table, or were held in the hands of those
experimenting. At a given moment, often
in the middle of a conversation, Madame
L. B. uttered a piercing cry and at the
same instant the bracelet would fall on the
floor, or on some piece of furniture, with
great force. Several times, under the same
circumstances,—that is to say, when the
lady’s hands were firmly pressed down on
the table by those experimenting,—I have
seen the bracelet <i>pass from one arm to the
other</i>.</p>

<p>So, in opposition to all laws of physics,
it appears that matter can pass through
matter; I affirm the reality of this, and
others, who are no more victims to hallucination
than I, can also testify to the truth
of this statement. And no matter what
may be the consequences to my professional
reputation, and utterly without regard
for anything that may be said by critics, I
boldly maintain, as if under oath, that my
senses lead me to this imposed conviction.
Besides, I am far from being alone in
believing what I have seen, whether or no
it be “<i>in harmony with our acquired knowledge</i>;”
to the names of French, English
and German <i>savants</i> I have cited, there are
experimenters in all countries who have
the courage to believe the evidence offered
by their own senses, as witness that celebrated
English geologist, who, after ten
years of investigation with the phenomena
under control, <i>declared spiritualism to be
true</i>, drawing from his experiments the following
conclusions: “<i>Who shall determine
the limits of the possible, limits that science and
observation accumulate each day? Let us examine,
let us doubt, but not be so daring as to deny
the possibility of such occurrences</i>” (Barkas).</p>

<p>If now we have established the balance-sheet
of facts attributed to the Demonomania
of the Middle Ages, and compared
them to the experiences of experimental
psychology, we are not only led to recognize
a striking analogy between them, but
also to interpret them by the hypothesis of
an intelligent force of an intensity proportionate
to certain nervous pathological conditions.
It is necessary to remember, in
fact, that, according to the Ritual of the
Roman Catholic Church, the phenomena
necessary to recognize <i>possession</i> among
Demonomaniacs were:</p>

<p>1. The faculty of knowing thoughts,
even though they are not expressed.</p>

<p>2. Intelligence in unknown languages.</p>

<p>3. The faculty of speaking foreign
tongues which are unknown to the party
speaking them.</p>

<p>4. A knowledge of future events.</p>

<p>5. A knowledge of what is transpiring
in far-off places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>78</span></p>

<p>6. Development of superior psychal
force.</p>

<p>7. Suspension of persons or bodies in
the air for a considerable space of time.</p>

<p>No less interesting is it than to compare
these phenomena to those observed by the
thirty-three members of the commission
appointed by the “Dialectic Society of
London.” The following was this committee’s
report, after eighteen months’ investigation:</p>

<p>1. Noises of varied nature, apparently
arising from the furniture, floor or walls of
the room, accompanied by vibrations which
are often perceptible to the touch, are present
without being produced by muscular
action or any mechanical means whatever.</p>

<p>2. Movements of heavy bodies occur
without the aid of mechanical apparatus of
any sort, and without equivalent development
of muscular force on the part of persons
present, and even frequently without
contact or connection with any one.</p>

<p>3. These noises and movements are
produced often at the moment wished for
and in the manner demanded by persons
present, and, by means of a simple code of
sounds, respond to questions and write
coherent communications.</p>

<p>4. The response and communications
obtained are, for the most part, hackneyed
and commonplace, but sometimes they
give facts and information only known to
one person in the room.</p>

<p>5. The circumstances under which the
phenomena are present vary, the most
striking feature being that the presence of
certain persons seems necessary to their
production, and that the presence of some
people serves as a check; but this difference
does not seem to depend on the belief
or the unbelief of those present as to the
nature of the phenomena.</p>

<p>The testimony, oral and written, received
by the commission affirmed the
reality of phenomena much more extraordinary
still, such as heavy bodies rising in
the air (men in certain cases floated
through the atmosphere) and remaining in
suspension without tangible support; apparitions
of hands and forms belonging to no
human beings, but seemingly alive, judging
by their aspect and motions.</p>

<p>This report was signed by <i>savants</i> of
the first order, as sceptical before commencing
their investigations as the most
positive Materialists of our academies of
science. Let us cite, among the
celebrated names of men known throughout
the world for their learning and scientific
veracity, those of the great naturalist and
<i>collaborateur</i> of Darwin, Russell Wallace,
Professor A. Morgan, President of the
Mathematical Society of London and Secretary
of the Royal Astronomical Society;
F. Varley, Chief Engineer of the Trans-Atlantic
Telegraph Company and member
of the Royal Society of London.</p>

<p>Mr. Morgan does not fear to add to the
report the following lines: “I am perfectly
convinced, from what I have seen and
heard, in a manner that renders doubt impossible,
that <i>Spiritualists</i>, without doubt,
are upon a track that will lead to the
advancement of the psychal sciences;
their opponents are those who seek to
trammel all progress.”</p>

<p>Mr. Varley writes to the celebrated
Professor Tyndall: “I am obliged to investigate
the nature of the force that produces
these phenomena, but, up to the
present time, I have been unable to discover
anything save the source from which
this <i>psychic force</i> emanates, <i>i.e.</i>, from the
vital systems of the mediums. I am only
studying, however, a thing that has been
the object of investigation for two thousand
years; brave men, whose minds are elevated
above the narrow prejudices of our
century, seem to have sounded the depths
of the subject in question,” etc.</p>

<p>This opinion of the learned English
physicist proves, once more, that we are
right in connecting Demonomania to the
magic of antiquity and to modern spiritualism.
One must be perfectly blind or of
poor judgment not to see the connecting
links that unite these various phenomena.
And if our men of science dare no longer
say that these facts are worthy of credit,
although refusing to investigate the same,
it is because they lack courage, it is because
they dare not brave the criticism of
pretended strong-minded men and the jests
of the ignorant. If the <i>vulgum pecus</i>, the
amorphous matter that stuffs the superior
element of society, contest the value of
the works of Crookes, Wallace, Morgan,
Varley, Gibier, Zoellner, Mapes, Hare,
Oxon, Sexton, and others, they can only
be included in the same class of people
who ridiculed Galileo, Harvey, Jenner,
Franklin, Young, Davy, Jussieu, Papin,
Stephenson, and Galvani, with all the
authors of great discoveries and scientific
truths, who have invariably been combatted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>79</span>
by the pseudo-scientific and half-fledged
goslings whose names adorn our
so-called colleges and other mutual admiration
societies.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Why, then, longer refuse to study <i>a
force</i> recognized by some of the most eminent
men among modern civilized nations
and by the modest pioneers who first
studied these phenomena in France? If
the number of experimenters named be not
sufficient to convince sceptics, let them
enter into a full study of present-day psychology,
and find a host of the greatest
modern neurologists.</p>

<p>Nine years of study has led Mr. Oxon,
Professor at the University of Oxford, to
formulate the following propositions on
<i>Psychic Force</i>, which corroborate the results
obtained by his colleagues in England,
Germany, and America, and which still
constitute another proof of the identity of
the phenomena:</p>

<p>“1. A force exists which acts by means
of a special type of human organization, a
force that we call <i>psychic force</i>.</p>

<p>“2. It is demonstrated that this force
is, in certain cases, governed by an intelligence.</p>

<p>“3. It is proved that this intelligence
is often other than that of the person or
persons through whose influence it acts.</p>

<p>“4. This Force, thus governed by an
exterior intelligence, at times manifests its
action, independent of other methods, by
writing coherent phrases, without the intervention
of any known mode of writing.</p>

<p>“5. The evidence of the existence of
this force governed by an intelligence rests
on</p>

<p>“(<i>a</i>) The evidence observed through
the senses.</p>

<p>“(<i>b</i>) The fact that <i>the force</i> often uses
a language unknown to the medium.</p>

<p>“(<i>c</i>) The fact that the subject matter
treated is very frequently superior to the
medium’s knowledge or education.</p>

<p>“(<i>d</i>) The fact that it has been found
impossible to produce the same results by
fraud under the conditions in which these
phenomena are obtained.</p>

<p>“(<i>e</i>) The fact that these special phenomena
are not only produced in public
and by paid mediums, but likewise in a
family circle where no strangers are admitted.”</p>

<p>Without writing to prejudice the question,
I believe, in my turn, that I can
solemnly affirm that this force has intimate
connection with the soul, the mind or the
ministerial part of our being, as it is called;
that it acts on our ideas as well as on our
physiological functions, and it is to my mind
the destiny of humanity to investigate its
essence and study its phenomena, its manifestations
and all its sensible effects by all
our senses and means of investigation.</p>

<p>It is high time that secular boasting of
the materialistic scientists be checked, and
that they should recognize the fact that
force does not arise from matter alone but
exists independent of it and primarily submits
to its laws.</p>

<p>Starting, then, with the proposition that
an unknown force exists, to whose influence
we unconsciously submit, science
should investigate this force, isolate, and
control it, if it be in our power so to do.</p>

<p>Instead of opposing an ignorant skepticism
to modern discoveries in <i>psychic force</i>,
our learned Academicians should investigate
the acquired facts for inspiration in
future work, remembering that good
thought of Laplace: “We are so far from
knowing all the agents of Nature and their
different modes of action, that it is not
philosophical to deny the existence of phenomena
simply because they cannot be explained
in the actual condition of our present knowledge.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Such are the conclusions I believe I
have a right to draw from my historical
studies on the Demonomania of the Middle
Ages. Let me briefly recapitulate my personal
views on the subject:</p>

<p>1. There exists a psychic force, intelligent,
inherent to humanity, manifesting
itself, under determined conditions, by
various phenomena, with an intensity more
or less great.</p>

<p>2. Certain human beings, known as
mediums, who are very sensitive to the
action of magnetism, facilitate the production
of these phenomena, considered as
supernatural in the actual state of our
present scientific knowledge, and in apparent
contradiction with all known physical
and physiological laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>80</span></p>

<p>3. In certain nervous conditions, natural
or provoked, this Force can possess the
human organism and bring about, temporarily,
either a change in one’s personality
or an alteration in one’s sensations and in
the intellectual and moral faculties.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="MEDICINE_IN_THE_LITERATURE_OF_THE">MEDICINE IN THE LITERATURE OF THE
MIDDLE AGES.</h2>
</div>


<p>All <i>savants</i> who have studied the literary
and historical part of medicine fully
recognize the powerful interest it offers,
especially that medicine portrayed in the
works of poets and dramatic authors of the
Middle Ages. It is in the works of these
writers, in fact, that we find the most exact
appreciation of medical ideas of the epoch,
because we can judge their morals, criticise
their faults, account for their tendencies—all
without bringing in medical science at any
given moment, with its teachings, errors,
and prejudices.</p>

<p>In all that concerns the Middle Ages,
we shall find this first in the writings of
philosophers, in certain dramatic works,
known under the name of <i>Moralities</i>, because
their purport was to demonstrate, under
the form of an allegory, a precept of morality.
The personages of such dramatic
scenes always represent ideas, often abstract
and usually fantastic,—The World,
Justice, Good Company, Gourmands, Dinner,
Banquet, Experience, Gout, Jaundice,
Dropsy, and Apoplexy. A second class,
errors and prejudices, are seldom wanting
in some poetical works, in <i>comedies and
farces</i>, <i>satirical</i> and <i>indecent</i> poems, that
recall some of the early productions of the
Latin Theatre. Eventually impressed with
the Gallic spirit of levity, these short
pieces, enjoyed by clerks and small tradesmen,
contain cutting criticisms on the
weaknesses of mankind, doctors in particular.
These plays are considered the
embryo of the French stage, which, later,
has been immortalized by the most illustrious
of our writers of comedy.</p>

<p>An unaffected gayety often breaks out
in brilliant, sparkling dialogues in these
frivolous farces, and assures the instant
success of the play. The public laughed
in high glee, without prudery, at the broad I
insinuations and comical acts in such representations.
So the writers of that period
went into raptures when they chanced to
make a hit with their satirical tirades, that
amused the passing age. Sometimes the
clergy were satirized as well as the doctor;
even the Pope himself received the attention
of the comedians, as witness the carnival
of 1511. Even the avarice of Louis
XII. was ridiculed. Comedy’s procession
represented Justice by its attorneys, shysters
and police; but, above all, comedy
delighted to burlesque the doctor, <i>Facultas
saluberrema medicinæ parisiensis</i>, ridiculing
them like the rest of the world, without the
least respect for their robe or bonnet.</p>

<p>Pray, what do these jolly, railing spirits
of the Middle Ages say of our medical
ancestors of the good old times? Master
Jehan Bouchet, for example, with his
piece, <i>Traverseur des voyes perilleuses</i>, and
Pierre Gringore under the pseudonym of
<i>Mere Sotte</i>, and Nicholas Rousset and
Coustellier, and Jacques Grevin and Pierre
Blanchet, and all other members of that
joyous group without care, without pretension,
but not without talent. If professional
honor was never really put on trial by these
wits, the pedantic gravity of our medical
forefathers, their formidable doctoral accoutrement,
their consultations, sentences
formulated in horrible and barbarous
Latin, were all the objects of raillery and
piquant epigrams. We shall find also, in
other works we propose to analyze, the
same false ideas of the public regarding the
healing art as exists to-day; the same tendency
to always lead one into error, and
unjustly accuse the medical profession of
all the accidents that happen to a patient—this,
too, notwithstanding all ancient
codes of hygiene and all the ages of experience.</p>

<p>When a physician prescribed, for example,
in the case of one attacked by
fever, the daily libations were stopped, and
we always find the neighbors and boon
companions of the sufferer enter the sick
room for the purpose of criticizing the doctor’s
prescriptions and orders, and such
persons excited the patient by their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>81</span>
remarks on medical despotism. This has
always been the case since doctors and patients
were created, not only in the Middle
Ages, but at all epochs. Olivier Basselin
bears testimony to this fact in one of his
charming <i>Vaux de Vire</i><a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> poetical compositions,
roundelays and Bacchic songs,
dating back to the sixteenth century; this
sonnet is not long;<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> it relates to a drunkard
to whom only barley water is given,
and who recovers his health, according to
the veracious poet, through a charitable
friend, who breaks the doctor’s orders and
fills the patient up with wine. We have
often read this poem with pleasure, and
give a condensed extract:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">One of my neighbors sick was lying,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Gasping with weak and feverish breath:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alas! they’ll kill me,” said he, sighing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Forbidding wine; and barley water’s death.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alas! my thirst is great, annoying;</div>

</div>

<p>The Bibliotheque of the French Theatre
contains a great number of other dramatic
compositions, as well as comedies and
farces, in which doctors carry principal
<i>roles</i>, it is true, but more often are introduced
for the mere purpose of giving the
author a chance for pleasantry at the expense
of medicine; and these characters
sometimes exceed the limit of license.
Some of these works are gems of literary
art. We may cite, for instance, the
“Farce of the Doctor who Cures all Diseases,”
by Nicholas Rousset; the
“Discours Facetieux” of Coustellier; “The
true Physician, who Cures all Known Diseases;”
and several besides, “La Medecine
de Maistre Grimache,” “Le Triomphe de
treshaulte et tres puissante Dame Verolle,”
of Francois Juste; “Mary and the Doctor,”
“The Sweetheart of the Family Physician,”
as well as some farces by Tabarin—works
dating back to the fifteenth, sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>But we shall only take up the study of
a few works that have a veritable literary
medical interest, and shall confine ourselves
to the study of the “Farces de
Maitre Pathelin, du Munyer et de la Folie
du Monde;” to the moralities of “A’aveugle
et du Boiteux, de Folie et d’Amour;”
to the comedies of “La Tresoriere et de
Lucelle;” to the tragedy “De la Goutte,”
and to the book of “Gargantua et de Pantagruel.”
This will suffice to give an idea
of medicine as portrayed in the literature
of the Middle Ages.</p>


<h3>THE FARCE OF MASTER PATHELIN.</h3>

<p>The farce of Master Pathelin, whose
author was Pierre Blanchet, is certainly
the richest jewel in the crown of the old
French Theatre; it was what inspired
Moliere in several of his works. Represented
for the first time in 1480, this celebrated
farce is one of the most precious
literary monuments for the study of Middle
Age morality. It is a <i>chef d’œuvre</i> of
spirit, malice, comedy, and <i>naivete</i>, in
which medicine is found in every scene,
either in the simulation of disease, with
consultations, with drugs, and, most
amusing of all, the eternal ingratitude of
the sick.</p>

<p>All the educated world knows the subject
of Master Pathelin: A lawyer without
a case or client; a man living on his wits
and expedients, making dupes and yet retaining
a certain degree of professional
correctness in his language and his artifices.
Guillemette, his wife, is his worthy
accomplice. It is she who reproaches him
with not having more clients and his reputation
of earlier days; of starving her to
death by famine. It is she who excites
him by ironically saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Maintenant chascun vous appelle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Partout; avocat dessoubz l’orme,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nos robes sont plus qu’estamine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reses.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And Pathelin responds that he cannot
get their clothing out of pawn without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>82</span>
redeeming or stealing it—both things out
of the question, as he has no money and
will not commit a crime. It is then that
the worthy couple hit on the credit system
to renew their wardrobe. It is for this purpose
he goes to a draper’s to purchase
cloth to make new clothes. On entering
the shop he uses the salutation of the
period, “God be with you,” and politely
inquires after the shopkeeper’s health,
which to him is very dear. Then he asks
after his father’s health, telling him he resembles
his sire like an old picture.
Finally, he takes sixteen yards of fine
cloth, and, telling the draper to call at his
house in the evening for his money and to
eat, as Master Pathelin expresses it, “a
Rouen goose roasted,” having invited the
astonished tradesman to dine with him, the
lawyer walks out with the cloth without
paying. Arriving home he relates his adventure
to the delighted Guillemette, who
is overpowered with bewilderment, however,
when she learns that the draper is invited
to a roast goose supper. At first it is
suggested that they borrow a tailor’s goose,
but fear that the draper will not appreciate
the joke and demand his money legally
induces the worthy couple to adopt a
strategem. It is very simple: Master
Pathelin is to feign insanity, or rather that
maniacal form of excitation so frequently
employed even at the present day by those
who seek to avoid the consequences of
crimes—an excitation principally characterized
by uncontrollable loquacity, mobility
of ideas, incoherence, and pretended
illusions.</p>

<p>These scenes of simulation are extremely
curious and interesting. As soon
as the draper enters the wife warns him
not to make a noise in the house:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He’s lying in bed. Don’t speak!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Poor martyr! he’s been sick a week.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the draper refuses to accept the explanation.
It cannot be a week, he says,
for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Tis only this afternoon, you see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your husband bought cloth from me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the voice of the attorney is heard
in the next room shouting to his wife:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Guillemette? Un peu d’eue rose!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Haussez moy, serrez-moy derriere!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trut! a qui parlay. Je? L’esguiere?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A boire? Frottez moy la plante.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Rose water in that century was
employed to reanimate the strength of sick
people. Among apothecaries it was called
<i>aqua cordialis temperata</i>. Rose water was
prescribed in the following cases: “<i>In
mortis subitis et malignis, ubicunque magnus
est virium lapsus præscribitur; quemadmodum
etiam prodest a morbo convalescentibus, ad vires
instaurandas.</i>”</p>

<p>Pathelin simulates hallucinations of
sight, and uses all manner of words employed
by magicians in their conjurations;
he asks the draper and Guillemette to put
a charm around his neck such as are used
to frighten away demons. He then, in his
ravings, abuses the doctors for their malpractice
and not understanding the quality
of his urine.(<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>) Notwithstanding all this
the draper is not convinced and demands
his money. We all know what importance
was attributed to the examination of the
urine in olden times, long before any
search was made for albumen, sugar, or
other morbid principles that it might contain.
Charlatans especially exploited in
this field of medicine, practicing it illegally
in the country under the name of <i>water
jugglers</i> or <i>water judges</i>. Such men still
practice in Normandy and certain northern
provinces of France.</p>

<p>The intestinal functions had also more
or less importance in the eyes of the public,
and the physician was not always consulted
as when to give physic. People
sent to an apothecary and ordered a clyster
with cassia and other ingredients, according
to the following formula of the pharmacopœia:
“<i>Cassia Pro Clysteribus. Est
eadem pulpa cassiæ cum decocto herbarum
aperitirarum extracta et saccharo Thomæo
condita. Oportet autem illas herbas adhibere
recentes, parumque decoquere, alias viribus
aperitivis omnio privantur; siccæ autem per
se carent virtute illa aperitiva.</i>”</p>

<p>In the “Revue Historique” of Angers
we find a document bearing on the private
life of Cardinal Richelieu; it has for its
title: “Things furnished for the person of
His Most Eminent Highness, the Cardinal
Duke Richelieu during the year 1635, by
Perdreau, apothecary to his Excellency.”
During the one year the Cardinal had used
seventy-five clysters and twenty-seven
cassia boluses, without counting other laxative
medicines and bottles of tisane, his
purgative bill amounting to 1401 livres<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>83</span>
and 14 sous. It is evident that Richelieu
was a badly constipated Cardinal.</p>

<p>It was a fine period for apothecaries,
and we might add that Moliere did them
considerable harm.</p>

<p>Let us return to Master Pathelin. He
was allowed a short breathing spell for
Guillemette, fought off the obdurate creditor
by making him leave the room a few
moments while her husband used the bedpan.</p>

<p>But this respite is of short duration;
the draper soon returns to demand his
cloth back or his money, although the wife
declares her husband “is dying in frenzy.”
Then commences another scene of maniacal
simulation in this wonderful psychological
play. In his pretended delirium,
Pathelin indulges in Limousin <i>patois</i>, Flemish,
Lower Breton; his words grow unintelligible
and incoherent in order to convince
the draper of his insanity.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mere de Diou, la coronade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Par fie, y m’en voul anar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or renague biou, outre mar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ventre de Diou, zen diet gigone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Castuy carrible, et res ne donne.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Let us pass from a wild Flemish
harangue, that possesses but little interest
even to those understanding the
dialects.</p>

<p>The psychic symptoms, which dominate
in the simulated delirium of Master Pathelin,
are especially incoherent in language
with mobility of ideas. The author of this
fine comedy had evidently observed the
progressive instability of thought among
certain maniacs, the impossibility of fixing
their attention, the too rapid succession of
ideas without order; in fact, that absolute
incoördination, a kind of cerebral automatism,
which is the announcement of the
breaking-down of intellectual faculties and
the prelude of absolute dementia. In his
ravings, Pathelin descants on the <i>Mal de
Saint Garbot</i>, or, more properly speaking,
Garbold; this was dysentery, although
such a scholar as Genin translates it as
meaning hemorrhoids. Saint Garbold who
was Bishop of Bayeux in the seventh century,
was driven out from his episcopal
chair by his diocesans, and, in order to be
avenged, sent them dysentery.</p>

<p>We may remark, in this connection,
that during the Middle Ages many maladies
were called after the Saints, whose aid
they invoked in given diseases; <i>Saint Ladre</i>
or <i>Lazare</i>, for leprosy; <i>Saint Roch</i>, for the
plague; <i>Saint Quentin</i>, for dropsy; <i>Saint
Leu</i>, <i>Saint Loupt</i>, <i>Saint Mathelin</i>, <i>Saint
Jehan</i>, <i>Saint Nazaire</i>, <i>Saint Victor</i>, for epilepsy,
fever, deafness, madness, etc.</p>

<p>The <i>mal Saint Andreux</i>, <i>mal Saint Antoine</i>,
<i>mal Saint Firmin</i>, <i>mal Saint Genevieve</i>,
<i>mal Saint Germain</i>, <i>mal Saint Messaut</i>, <i>mal
Saint Verain</i>, designated erysipelas, scurvy,
etc. Drunkenness was called the <i>mal
Saint Martin</i>.</p>

<p>Syphilis naturally had its patron Saint;
in fact, it was known as <i>mal Saint homme
Job</i>, <i>Saint Merais</i>, <i>Saint Laurant</i>, <i>mal Saint
Eupheme</i>, etc. In fact, all diseases had as
an attachment the name of one or more
Saints, at whose shrine the afflicted might
implore aid.</p>

<p>But to return to Master Pathelin: After
numerous tirades he finishes by acknowledging
his deceit to the draper. This is
an epitome of the farce of Master Pierre
Pathelin, a medical study that had an immense
run in the fifteenth century and
remains a valuable document regarding
French morality in the Middle Ages, as
interesting to the student of psychology as
to the Theatre. Some years after this
(1490) the sequel to Master Pathelin
appeared, called the “Last Will of Pathelin,”
which is also full of strange medical
conceits appertaining to the age in which
it was written. In this piece, Pathelin,
after years of fraud and deceit, really becomes
ill and sends for the lawyer and
priest, abandoning the doctor to a certain
extent. In his will he leaves all his ailments
to different religious orders and
charitable institutions, as, for instance, one
<i>item</i> of his will reads as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Au quatre convens aussi,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cordeliers, Carmes, Augustins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jacobins, soient ors, on Soient ens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Je leur laisse tous bons lopins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A tous chopineurs et y vrongnes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Notre vueil que je leur laisse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toutes goutes, crampes et rongnes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Au poing, au coste, a la fesse,” etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But enough of Master Pathelin. Let
us now turn to the consideration of another
curious farce.</p>


<h3>LA FARCE DE MUNYER.</h3>

<p>This farce, whose author was Andre de
la Vigne, dates back, like preceding one,
to the fourteenth century. The miller of
the Middle Ages, the ancestor of our
present Jack-pudding (French slang for
miller), was in antique times the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>84</span>
rascally and cheating type of trader, from
whence the old Gascon proverb, “One
always finds a thief in a miller’s skin.”</p>

<p>In this farce we see the miller “lying
in bed as though sick,” uttering long
groans and sighing over the pains he professes
to endure—groans, however, to
which his wife appears insensible. He
commences thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now am I in sore distress,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My sickness hard to cure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My sore discomfort is not less.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Heart-ache I can’t endure.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To this his wife responds indifferently,
although the miller persists in asking for a
bottle of good wine, saying that his “reins
and belly need the supreme consolation of
the bottle.” The wife obstinately refuses
her husband the wine, remarking that he
cannot “repair his stomach by filling the
belly;” but, instead, she sends for the
priest, who is, moreover, her lover, and
carries on a flirtation with the holy man in
the presence of her husband, for the purpose
of making the invalid rise from his
sick-bed; but, thinking his end near, the
miller demands that he shall be permitted
to die in the faith, or “<i>mourir catholiquement</i>.”
He confesses to the priest, avowing
all his thefts, his frauds, his falsification
and <i>amours</i>, and is prepared to render his
soul.</p>

<p>But the miller has absorbed some of the
popular ideas of his day, professed by certain
philosophers of the time; he believes
that, at the moment of death, the soul
of man escapes by his anus, and warns
the priest to absolve him from his sins,
saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mon ventre trop se determine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Helas! Je ne scay que je face;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ostez vous!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The priest answers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha! sauf vostre grace!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the miller remarks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ostez vous, car je me conchye.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The wife and the priest pull the sick
man to the edge of the bed and place him
in such a position that, if the doctrine of
soul departure by the anus be true, they
may witness the miller’s final performance.
The phenomenon of rectal flatulence is now
observed, when suddenly to the consternation
of the wife and priest, a demon
appears, and placing a sack over the dying
miller’s anus catches the rectal gas and
flies off in sulphurous vapor. In the next
act we see the Devil appear before his
patron Lucifer bearing the sack supposed
to contain the damned soul of the miller
received in the aforesaid sack at the moment
it escaped from the anus. The devil
is commanded by Lucifer to empty the
sack at the feet of Proserpine who is busily
engaged in cooking in Hell’s kitchen, but
in place of the miller’s soul they only find
<i>spoiled bran</i>; the rascal has cheated even
in death.</p>

<p>It seems strange that earlier comedy
writers all showed a tendency to make
their principle scenes pathological burlesques.
Thus in many plays the heroes and
heroines were attacked by colic in order to
excite the laughter of the audience, when
the buffoon would imitate by signs the act
of defecation. This peculiar French gayety
and lack of prudery is fully evidenced in
the comic effects of Pourceaugnac with the
detersive, insinuative and carminative clysters
of Moliere.</p>

<p>This farce, had in former days, an immense
success, and is still occasionally
played, being considered a <i>chef d’œuvre</i> of
malice and humor by our best critics and
most distinguished authors. In France
the audience always laugh when a thief
while plundering is suddenly taken with
pains in his bowels and diarrhœa, while a
rectal syringe flourished aloft as a weapon
of defense will bring down the gallery in a
storm of applause.</p>


<h3>L’AVEUGLE ET LE BOITEUX</h3>

<p>Is another play in which medicine acts a
part, by the same author of the preceding
farce; the plot is as follows: A blind
man and a lame man implore public charity
on a deserted road; the blind man deplores
his fate as never having seen the light, and
the lame man bitterly bemoans not being
able to walk but a few steps at one time,
on account of the gout which has rendered
him paraplegic. These two make a mutual
avowal of their infirmities and agree to
form a copartnership for mutual assistance;
the lame man climbs on the blind man’s
shoulders and they start out the road in
search of charitable persons who may aid
them with alms. On going some little distance
the beggars hear a noise; this is made
by a procession of monks going on a pilgrimage
to the tomb of Saint Martin. “What
do they say?” asks the blind man; to
which the lame man responds:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>85</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They tell of things curious and quaint,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of miracles, wonderous, if true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Performed by a newly made saint,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For whose aid each monk goes to sue;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This Saint cures all ills he can find,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even fits, ulcers, fevers and gout;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He <i>healeth the halt</i> and the blind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a manner that’s past finding out.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We all know the eternal popular faith
and belief in the ability of the Saints to
cure every malady that flesh is heir to.
However, in the present instance, it seems
that one of the requirements necessary to
be healed was a perfect spirit of resignation
to all ills on the part of the sufferer—<i>now
this is the case of our two mendicants</i>, who
now become alarmed at the idea that they
may be cured and thus deprived of a
method of earning their daily bread, <i>i.e.</i>,
by beggary, so they undertake a number of
subterfuges to escape the pious pilgrimage,
which gives rise to many amusing adventures
and situations, which might be well
utilized by some modern playwriter. In
the end the two mendicants escape from
going with the pilgrim monks to visit the
Saint’s shrine, as the blind man detests the
light and the lame man is too lazy to walk,
in fact both are admirably suited with
their afflictions. It is during one of these
scenes that the lame man relates to the
blind man the best methods for deceiving
the public by simulating maladies, and
making a regular profession of begging.
He discloses all the secrets of those who in
the Middle Ages sought public commiseration
to earn alms; he remarks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Puisque de tout je suis reffait,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Maulgre mes deus et mon visage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tant feray, que seray deffaict,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Encore ung coup de mon corsaige,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Car je vous dis bien que encor scay—je”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“La grant pratique et aussi l’art,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Par onguement et par herbaige,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Combien que soye miste et gaillart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Que huy on dira que ma jambe art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Du cruel mal de Sainct Anthoyne,” etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this lengthy poem, too long to transcribe
from the French, the lame mendicant
gives a list of herbs, through means of
which various diseases may be simulated,
especially those maladies of the skin that
are repulsive to the majority of mankind;
thus he describes the itch produced by
certain varieties of the <i>clematis</i> and the
appearance of leprosy induced by the use
of an ointment of which <i>veronica</i> formed
the basis. He also describes how to produce
the disease of <i>Saint Fiacre</i>, an
affection characterized by warts and ulcers
around the anus. It is useless to add there
is nothing new under the sun. Let us now
turn our attention to another play, <i>i.e.</i>;</p>


<h3>LUNACY AND LOVE.</h3>

<p>This is a play with six characters, written
in 1556, by Louise Labe, sometimes
called the <i>Belle Cordiere</i>.</p>

<p>Love, at all periods of time, has served
as an inexhaustible subject of analysis and
observation, not only to poets and novelists,
but also to moralists, and especially physicians.
Psychologists have always considered
love, when excessive, as an evidence
of insanity. Esquirol says that
“love has lost its empire in France, indifference
having captivated the hearts of our
people, who, given over to amorous passions,
having neither purity nor exhaltation,
engender attacks of erotic lunacy.” This
learned alienist has also discovered that
out of 323 cases of insanity among the
poor, love figured as a cause in forty-six
cases; and out of 167 cases among the
rich, twenty-five persons went insane on
account of love. These close relations
between “Lunacy and Love,” admitted
since mankind <i>entered into society</i>, have
served as a text for the Middle Ages, as is
witnessed by the title of the play we have
mentioned; a work the more curious, for
reason of its <i>finesse</i>, notwithstanding the
jests employed by its author as the following
analysis will witness.</p>

<p>Love and Lunacy arrive at the same
moment at a festival to which Jupiter has
convened all the Gods. Lunacy, full of
arrogance, wishes to enter the banquet-hall
before Love, and in order to do so
turns everything topsy-turvy to secure his
end. The vindictive Love, in order to be
avenged, discharges a flight of arrows from
the historical quiver; but Lunacy avoids
these by becoming invisible, and in his
wrath pulls out Love’s eyes, but afterwards
skilfully puts them back in place with a
bandage.</p>

<p>Love, in despair at being blinded, goes
to implore the help of his mother. The
latter desires the boy to remove the bandages
from his eyes, but his efforts are useless;
they are full of knots. Venus calls
on Jupiter for justice for the injury done
her boy. The Father of Gods accepts the
position of arbitrator and cites the offender
to appear before his tribunal. Mercury
acts as attorney for Lunacy and Apollo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>86</span>
does the special pleading for Love. In the
cross-examination, Love tries to inform
Jupiter of the fashions of loving, and tells
him if he desires true affection and happiness
to descend to earth, drop all appearances
of greatness, and, under the guise of
a simple mortal, seek to captivate some
earthly beauty. Apollo, speaking for his
client, young Cupid, is so eloquent that all
the assemblage of Gods is seduced by his
oratory, and condemns Lunacy without
even giving him a hearing. But Jupiter is
impartial in his tribunal, and allows Mercury
to argue for the defense. The latter
pleads, in turn, with such eloquence that
one-half the jury is ready to say that
Lunacy is not guilty—at least among
Olympian jurors. Jupiter is undecided;
he is very wise, however, and makes the
following decision. “Owing to the differences
of witnesses and the importance of
the case, we have set the case for a re-hearing
in three times seven times nine centuries—18,900
years—until which time Folly,
or Lunacy, shall lead the Blind (Cupid)
anywhere she chooses to go; and, at the
end of the time named, should Cupid’s
eyes be restored, the Fates may decree
otherwise.”</p>

<p>Lunacy and Love are thus rendered inseparable
and eternal on earth; they are
connected together for the happiness of
humanity and the delight of psychologists,
philosophers and moralists, who will always
find in these subjects something new for
meditation and study. Need we add, also,
that the alienists will secure any number
of clients owing to Jupiter’s decision?</p>

<p>Let us now turn to a brief mention of</p>


<h3>THE TREASURER’S WIFE.</h3>

<p>This comedy, by Jacques Grevin, a
medical poet, born at Clermont, was written
in the sixteenth century. This physician,
from his earliest youth, was enamored
with the daughter of one of his confreres,
Charles Etienne; she was a noted beauty,
but preferred another doctor, Jean Liebaut,
the author of “La Maison Rustique,” to
our poet. In order to console himself for
the loss of his sweetheart, Grevin commenced
to write rhymes, and even surpassed
Jodelle, the author of “Cleopatra
and Dido,” by his fecundity. He followed
Marguerite de France, wife of the Duke
of Savoy, to whom he was family physician,
to Turin, and died there in 1570.</p>

<p>He left several plays in verse, the
principal one of which was “La Tresoriere,”
an adulterous comedy relating to the intrigue
of a financier’s wife. It is only of
medical interest inasmuch as it alludes to
syphilis, which at the time this play was
written prevailed in Europe almost as an
epidemic, and as a study of the morals of
the epoch is not without interest to the
syphilographer. The author, probably
owing to his early disappointment in love,
had but a poor opinion of the virtue of the
women in his century, and makes many
odd comparisons, as, for instance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Woman, ’tis often been said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Resembles a church lamp bright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That hangs on the altar overhead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And outshines the candles at night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She sheds an equal light on all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But without her light, no shadows fall.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He was no believer in the morality
of the aristocratic classes, and alludes to
the laxity of social rules and the spread of
syphilis in the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Aussi la femme a beau changer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Un familier a l’etranger,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">L’etranger au premier venu,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toujours son cas est maintenu</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">En son entier, si d’aventure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Elle n’y mele quelqu’ ordure.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The reference to the syphilis is here
found in the two last lines; if she has a
love affair, there is ordure in the result.
The allusion in other passages is much
more apparent, but too impolite for an
English rendering.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to another curious old
French play,</p>


<h3>LUCILLE AND INNOCENCE UNCOVERED.</h3>

<p>Pharmacists, even at the present day,
notwithstanding the rigid laws to the contrary,
often sell narcotics without a prescription.
That the modern druggist only
follows the custom of his ancestor is evidenced
by this comedy of the sixteenth
century, by Louis Le Jars, <i>i.e.</i>, “Lucille.”</p>

<p>The plot is as follows: At the moment
a rich banker gives the hand of his daughter
Lucille to the Baron Saint Amour, he
learns that the former has been already
secretly married to one of his clerks, a
young man named Ascagne. In his wrath
the banker places a pistol at Ascagne’s
head, offering him at the same moment a
goblet of poison, giving him his choice as
to the manner of death. Ascagne chooses
poison, and bravely drinks half the goblet
and falls down, apparently inanimate. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>87</span>
father then has the body of Ascagne
carried into his daughter’s presence, and
also the remaining half-goblet of poison;
the young woman does not hesitate to
drain the other half of the poison to the
dregs, and drops to the floor, like Ascagne,
without consciousness.</p>

<p>Almost immediately following this
double poisoning, a courier arrives and demands
Ascagne, who turns out to be the
son of the King of Poland. The banker
is in despair, and sends post-haste for the
apothecary who furnished the poison, and
the druggist forthwith declare that the mixture
is only a narcotic, the effects of which
he can soon neutralize. Scene of overpowering
tenderness and joy, and marriage
over again to a real Prince.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that physicians
themselves give away opiates without regard
for the rights of the <i>medicamentarius
renenum coquens</i> of the neighborhood. Jean
Auvray, Member of the French Parliament
and poet, evidences this fact in a tragio-comedy
entitled “Innocence Uncovered.”
This little play is only a rural version of
Phedra and Hippolyte. Marsilie, in fact,
is in love with Fabrice, the son of Phocus,
her husband, by a former marriage. Her
passion for the young man is so violent
that she falls ill, and in a visit made her by
Fabrice the latter learns of the love his
step-mother bears him, but loyally repulses
her advances. Marsilie, reflecting on the
infamy of her conduct, wishes to kill herself
in a fit of remorse; but to prevent this
and calm her, Fabrice promises that if she
will not suicide he will visit her when his
father is absent from home. Phocus soon
starts on a journey. Marsilie recalls to
Fabrice the promise he made, but Fabrice
answers her offers with contempt and quits
her presence overcome with horror. Acting
under the advice of her maid servant,
through fear that the young man may tell
his father of her perfidy, Marsilie consents
to poison Fabrice, and sends her <i>valet</i>,
Thomas, to see a doctor and thus secure
poison. The unfortunate <i>valet</i> is very
much embarrassed and cannot tell the
physician exactly what he desires, and in
order to obtain some deadly drug he details
the symptoms of an imaginary malady,
and descants in the following manner:
“Sir, for several days past my master,
who exceeds the Persians as a gourmand in
the cooking of delicious meats, gave a
grand dinner party, equal to that of the
Gods at the wedding festival of Thetis.
Now, know that I, his principal servant,
sat behind him; there by his order I
tasted every dish brought in by the butler,
when such a terrible fury broke forth in
my belly that I was overcome with fright
and agony. The rumblings and grumblings
in my interior were only comparable to the
reverberation of thunder claps among the
highest crags of Tartarus. Hell was astonished
and our castle walls shook,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>This narration, which is made in
French rhyme and is too long for reproduction,
naturally leads the doctor to prescribe
for the impudent <i>valet</i>, who proposes
to pay him a hundred crowns for enough
poison to kill his master. The physician is
angry and revengeful at the same time at
the <i>valet’s</i> dreadful proposition, but, restraining
himself, he accepts the gold and
gives Thomas in place of poison only a
soporific liquor; this the valet brings to his
mistress, Marsilie. Now, Antoine, the
only son of Marsilie by Phocus, returning
from the chase, sees the flagon of liquor,
and, mistaking it for wine, swallows the
contents at one draught. He falls to the
floor unconscious and all believe him dead.
Marsilie accuses Fabrice of poisoning his
stepbrother; the unfortunate young man is
taken before the judge, who condemns
him to death; he is about to be executed,
when the physician enters on the scene,
tells all that has passed, and restores to life
the supposed dead Antoine.</p>

<p>Marsilie is tried and found guilty and
repudiated by her husband and family;
and Fabrice becomes dearer than ever to
his father. Without making further commentaries
on this piece, we see the place
occupied on the stage by medicine in the
Middle Ages and the social standing of the
physician in polite society. We also note
the <i>irregular</i> practice of the doctor, as well
as the high standard of professional honor
he maintained in many instances.</p>


<h3>THE GOUT.</h3>

<p>This tragedy, in poetic form, was composed
towards the close of the sixteenth
century by J. D. L. Blambeausaut. It has
only three scenes, and depicts the triumph
of the gout. The poet describes an old
man overcome by the multiple pains of
podagra, praying to obtain some slight
respite from the atrocious and agonizing
pain he endures. The Gout, an ever
malevolent deity, rejects the old ma<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>88</span>n’s
prayer for help, but carries him into a
gathering of doctors who are vaunting, in
mutual admiration society fashion, their
power in jugulating all forms of disease
and exalting their specifics for every
known affection. In order to punish these
arrogant disciples of Æsculapius for their
presumption, the Gout gives them all the
disease that bears his name, and afterwards
jeers at their impotent efforts to cure themselves
of aching joints.</p>

<p>This tragedy, name given by the author
of the poem, is a very curious treatise on
the gout in rhyme, in which we find all the
pathogenetic theories given credence before
the time that medical chemistry revealed
the action of an excess of uric acid
in the organism. The blood, bile, peccant
humors settling in the parts affected were,
as we all know, causes attributed to diathesis
by the majority of medical authors of
the Middle Ages. Thus the gout-afflicted
man, in his imprecations against what he
calls “the torturer of humanity,” comes to
say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From the top of my head to the end of my toes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am cruelly tortured by agony’s woes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Filled up with black blood and billious humor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My flesh seems to pulsate like a sore tumor.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The eating and gnawing I can’t describe well;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My tendons all ache with the twinges of Hell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While through my fingers pains cut like a knife</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And add to my torment! I’m weary of life.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Meantime our patient does not appear
to have a robust faith in the humoral
theories of his physician, for he adds, in
accursing the malady that has ruined his
health, that it permits him no repose:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mal que jamais l’homme n’a pu comprendre</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qui le plus sage induirait a se pendre.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That is to say, that the doctors do not
understand how to manage the disease, a
common idea among patients who are not
cured of their malady as speedily as they
desire.</p>

<p>In one of the scenes the gout addresses
a pompous eulogy on its power over
humanity, and inveighs against those physicians
who discover a new specific against
gout every day. This list of remedies for
the disease is appalling; we cull but a few
to satisfy the reader’s curiosity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“One advises flea wort and a parsley pill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One eats fruit at morning, when with gout he’s ill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One chews leaves of lettuce, one takes wild purslain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Another smells pond lilies, when he doth complain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some remedies most curious are for gout deemed good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such are herbs and simples to purify the blood;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Angelica and gentian, the iris and green thyme,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Along with fresh culled myrtle will cure it all the time;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hyssop and lavender, cherry and water cress,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Basil, hops and anise, all make the pain grow less.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lentills, sage and savory, when the bowels they unbind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the marvelous merchoracan that comes from far off Ind.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s the beauteous laurel leaf that crowneth bard and king,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Privet and cardamoms, whose praise we often sing.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there’s the sleeping poppy, what peace within it resides,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Culled by the Turkish houris in the garden Hesperides;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s the soothing comfrey and the glorious hoarhound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the magic betal nut, in tropic isles that’s found;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s the fragrant <i>fleur de lis</i>, when with pain you cry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s the odorous sheep dung, given always on the sly.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some dote on peach blossoms; some on saffron red,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some like hyoscyamus mixed with piss-a-bed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s bread crumbs and fennel mixed with young carrots</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pounded in a mortar along with eschalots.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There are some who use an ointment this disease to heal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made of rinds of citron and golden orange peel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With frankencense and veratria root, to ease gouty pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Applied to the great toes on the leaves of green plantain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s saltpeter ointment too, when to the foot applied</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It makes the patient furious wroth, or else he’s terrified,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Giving the gout new twinges, and the sufferer spasms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only eased by eggs and flour in a soft cataplasm.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some patients take a razor and their own flesh deeply cut;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wound then duly poulticed is with meal and Cyprus nut.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some take red cabbage when other methods fail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And eat it with vinegar mixed with the slime of snail;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some use biting dressings made from ugly lizards,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pounded up with doe’s hoof and weasel gizzards.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many think a certain and most efficacious cure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is a little blue stone ointment mixed with man’s ordure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a celebrated surgeon, a knight of great renown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Used virgin urine as a cure for all the men in town.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some wear charms like foxes’ tails, or a beaver tooth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Others boil a new born caul and chew it up, forsooth,” etc., etc., <i>ad nauseam</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>89</span></p>
<p>Such are a few of the drugs employed
against the gout, and certainly we cannot
enumerate all the remedies spoken of by
this malevolent demon. The treatment of
Alexander Trallian, for example, is no less
odd than many of the recipes given in this
poetic formulary; it was composed of
myrrh, coral, cloves, rue, peony and birthwort
pounded together and mixed in certain
proportions, and prescribed as an antidote
to the gout for the space of 365 days, in
the following manner: To be taken for
100 consecutive days, and then omitted for
thirty days; then taken for another 100
days, with fifteen days omission afterwards;
finally, every other day for 360 days.
Circumcision was also a remedy, only
applicable to Christians for obvious
reasons.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>This treatment is an example of the
methodical system, and “rests upon superstitious
gifts,” says Sprengel. But there
are some merits discoverable even in this
apparent superstition, <i>i.e.</i>, the great truth
that the gout is a constitutional disease
produced by luxury, and consequently incurable
by medicines; a severe regimen
being imposed, at the same time foolish
prescriptions were given; it was the dieting
and not the formula that made Alexander
Trallian’s treatment so successful.
However, it must not be forgotten that
some medicines had a powerful effect in
attenuating the violence of the gouty
attack; it was for this reason that Cœlius
Aurelianus resorted to purgatives and
mineral waters; and among the drugs used
by chance in the Middle Ages were found
the flowers and bulbs of colchicum; the
haughty Demon of Gout dared not treat
this remedy with disdain.</p>

<p>Meantime the <i>Gout</i> addressed the following
lines to the physicians and <i>mires</i>
of the age.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Gardez vous, Siriens;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Menteurs magiciens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vendeurs de theriaque,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qu’elle ne vous attaque.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To call the doctor of ancient times a
“<i>vender of Theriacum</i>” was an insult to
professional pride. This absurd remedy
was invented by one of Nero’s slaves, and
held a high place in public estimation.
“It was laid down in the pharmacopœias,
<i>ad ostentationem artis</i>,” says Pliny, “and enjoyed
a reputation that was never justified
by its thirty-six ingredients and the varied
assortment of inert gums entering into its
composition.”</p>

<p>In the third scene of the tragedy, the
Demon Gout, recalls to the memory of the
doctors of the Middle Ages, its illustrious
victims of antiquity.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Priam, disposed to run, had gout;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Achilles was too lame to get about;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bellerophon’s saddle toes complained;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ædipus had big joints that pained;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Plisthenes on his feet, all swollen stood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cursing the gout that coursed with his blood.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How many other of the great have
wept with the gout?</p>

<p>Then calling his faithful servitors, Pain,
Insomnia, and Indigestion, the Demon
Gout bids them plunge his fiery darts into
his enemies, to burn them with an unquenchable
flame:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Toy, brule ici par des douleurs nouvelles</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Le chef premier, les cuisses et tendons,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Toy, convertis leur nerfs en noir charbons,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et vous aussi, d’une fureur soudaine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Froissez leurs mains, rendez leur drogue vaine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With this superb peroration, he afflicts
all good doctors with the gout and rheumatism.
Since that day physicians the world
over, says our talented author, J. D. L.
Blambeausaut, have been the victims of
this horrible malady. Let us now turn to
the consideration of a curious hygienic
play, no less interesting than that of the
Gout,</p>


<h3>CONDEMNATION OF HIGH LIVING AND PRAISE
OF DIET AND SOBRIETY.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></h3>

<p>This moral play, to which we might
give the title of hygienic poetry, appeared
in 1507, under the name of its author,
Nicolas de la Chesnaye, along with another
work, the latter in prose, on the “Government
of the Human Body.”</p>

<p>Nicolas de la Chesnaye was not only a
poet but a doctor. He was a physician of
enough importance to be personal friend
and medical attendant of Louis XII, at
whose instigation the poetical play was
written. This work is considered by many
French critics to be a classic of its kind; it
is a poem dealing with all the curious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>90</span>
manners and customs of the time, and
treats of morality and the stage. In a prologue
Nicole de la Chesnaye informs us
how he came to be a poet, or, rather, a
writer of verses to be recited on the public
stage, in which were embodied the hygienic
and dietetic precepts of the epoch, together
with the medical doctrines in vogue.
Let us cite a few lines from this prologue:
“Oh, ye who write or attempt to follow
copies of ancient works, ye should strive to
omit such phrases as are difficult to be
understood by the masses of the people;
endeavor then to not exceed in quantity
and quality their mental capacity and your
own understanding. On such an occasion
as this, I, who am ignorant as compared to
many among ye, have had the hardihood
to compose and put in rhyme this little
play of mine upon morality. The intention
of this work is to make an exterminating
war on gluttony, debauchery, inebriety,
and avariciousness, and to praise and extol
temperance, virtue, sobriety, and generosity,
to the end of improving mankind.
So in this work I have given the personages
of my play the names of different
maladies, as, for example, Apoplexy, Epilepsy,
Dropsy, Jaundice, Gout, etc., etc.”</p>

<p>The object of the author’s play is thus
plainly stated at the outset. In the first
act we see Dinner, Supper, and Banquet
conniving against honest gentlemen by inviting
them to feast. Among the plotters
are also Good Company, Fried Meats,
Gourmandizer, Drink Hearty, and others.
In the midst of the festivities rascals fall
on the assembled guests and give them
deadly blows; these villains are Apoplexy,
Gout, Epilepsy, Gravel, and Dropsy. Almost
all the guests present are more or less
injured, and upon their complaint their
assailants are cited to appear before a court
held by Judge Experience, while the attorneys
for the plaintiffs and defendants are
Remedy, Medical Aid, Sobriety, Diet,
and Old Pills. The trial, carried on in
rhyme, is piquant and amusing, and ends
in the conviction of Supper, who is condemned
to wear bread and milk handcuffs.
Dinner is doomed to a long exile on penalty
of being hung should he return. Supper
is well pleased with the light sentence.
One of the attorneys abuses wine during
the course of his argument for plaintiffs, as,
for instance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Good wine is full of wicked lies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine a wise man will despise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine corrupts the blood and tongue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine has many a fellow hung.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine lascivious men will rue.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine, though red, makes drinkers blue.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine means lost ability,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine means lost docility.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine means jaundiced liver pain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine means a wild, raving brain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine means arson, murder, lust,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine means prison chains and rust.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine means broken family ties.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine means woman’s tears and sighs.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine makes cowards of the brave.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Good wine digs a good drinker’s grave.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He then goes on and gives examples,
as, for instance, Alexander the Great killing
his foster-brother Clitus at a drinking
banquet; he cites the opinions of Saint
Jerome and Terrence; he depicts Lot debauching
his daughters and Noah exposed
to the mockery of his sons; he shows
Holofernes decapitated by Judith, and
places all these cases to the credit of intemperance.
Then he adds a long list of
diseases resulting from drink, of which we
shall only quote one verse of the original:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“D’ou vient gravelle peu prisie</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Y dropsie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Paralisie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Ou pleuresie’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Collicque qui les boyaulx touche?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dont vient jaunisse, ictericie</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Appoplexie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Epilencie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Et squinancie?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tout vient de mal garder la bouche.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In quaint old French all the symptoms
of alcoholism are perfectly enumerated. It
is evident that the epilepsy mentioned by
the author is only the epileptiform convulsion
noticed in modern cases of chronic
drunkenness.</p>

<p>As to the <i>ictericie</i>, which a modern
critic has translated as meaning <i>black
humor</i>, it is nothing more than what is now
known as cirrhosis of the liver. Nicole de
la Chesnaye was a physician; his critical
commentator not much of one. We cannot
follow this classical author through the
innumerable reasons he gives for blaming
liquor drinking and his high tributes of
praise to the cause of Middle Age temperance,
and we cannot quote those original
strophes on the ancient satirical poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Le satirique Juvenal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Avoit bien tout cousidere.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quand il dist qu’il vient tant de mal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">De long repas immodere,” etc., etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In another scene the drunken revelry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>91</span>
of the Banqueters is re-enacted, on the return
of the convicts from exile, and another
temptation to the weak and young
and foolish. In fact, one of the youths
present, Folly (<i>Le Fol</i>), is attacked and
badly used up by the villain Gravel. The
poor fellow cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alarme! Je ne puis pisser</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">La Gravelle me tient aux rains!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Venez ouyr mes piteux plains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vous, l’Orfevre et l’Appoticaire.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then follows a comical scene of suffering,
couched in such language as would
offend modern ears polite, and, therefore,
out of respect to the reader omitted.</p>

<p>In this play are many dialogues between
Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna, and
Averrhoes, who discuss medical topics at
length, but these are too lengthy for reproduction

<p>The morality of Nicole de la Chesnaye
is full of good intentions, but it is questionable
whether he accomplished any considerable
result in reforming the morals of
the Middle Ages; he perhaps fell as short
in his aim as modern hygienists on the
morality of our own epoch. The same instincts
predominate now as in days of
antiquity; the society man of to-day is
generally a mere digestive tube, serving to
keep alive the more or less badly served
vital organs.</p>


<h3>THE FOLLY OF THE WORLD.</h3>

<p>This is a farce by the same Nicole de la
Chesnaye. It was acted in 1524, and one
of his chief personages in the play depicted
a doctor of the period. The following is a
short analysis of this really curious piece:</p>

<p><i>Grandmother Sottie</i> leads to the <i>World</i>
several persons whom she desires the latter
to watch while plying their avocations; the
<i>shoemaker</i> makes his boots <i>too tight</i> always;
the <i>dressmaker’s</i> dresses are ever <i>too large</i>;
the <i>priest’s</i> masses are said <i>too long</i> or <i>too
short</i>. This bad showing on the part of
the World’s workers make his mundane
majesty sick. He sends a specimen of his
urine to the doctor, who, after a scientific
examination, declares the World’s brain is
affected, and also that his new-found client
must be visited in person. On meeting the
World he interrogates him as to his health,
and asks questions which might serve to
make a diagnosis. The World tells the
doctor he is no longer afraid of water on
the brain, but of being consumed in a
deluge of fire. The doctor then utters the
following wise and rather satirical observations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“World! be not troubled in thinking of fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Let your mind on that score be at peace.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Know that each monk, and low, rascally <i>friar</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sells and buys a good, fat benefice;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why, even the children, your subjects in arms,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Are born to be <i>Abbots</i>, <i>Bishops</i>, and <i>Priors</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While church-bells keep ringing false fire alarms.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But, great World, <i>all the clergy</i> are liars!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their flattering’s truly their sweetest incense,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Yet the parasites fawn for your treasures;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah! church love for war was ever intense,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And their doctrines mar all earthly pleasures.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The World is so impressed by the doctor’s
remarks that he immediately weds
Folly. Ever since, it is needless to remark,
the World has enjoyed pleasure without
as much dread of fire. It is an easy
matter to seize the apologue sought by the
author.</p>

<p>Here we see, as early as the sixteenth
century, the social reforms begun by medicine
and continued up to the eighteenth
century. The abbots, priors and other
gentry of the Church, who lived in idleness
and luxury, holding sinecures for which
the masses were taxed; the flatterers of
bastard princes, the agents of the rich and
aristocratic, ruled the country and made
wars costing thousands of lives for the
glory of the Church—<i>i.e.</i>, <i>themselves</i>. These
are the parasites that epidemically attack
the <i>World</i>.</p>


<h3>GARGANTUA AND PANTAGRUEL.</h3>

<p>Among the famous galaxy of philological
stars of the sixteenth century, the men
who honored their age, we may enumerate
Montaigne, Amyot, Calvin, Marot, Michel
de l’Hospital, Etienne Dolet,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and the
one great genius who eclipsed them all, the
immortal Rabelais, who was at once physician,
philosopher, politician, philanthropist
and <i>litterateur</i>; in other words, he illustrated
science and letters by his erudition, and
merits a place in the ranks of glorious
Frenchmen and among the list of benefactors
of humanity.</p>

<p>Son of a wine-house keeper, the owner
of the “Lamprey Tavern,” at Chinon, he
took orders in the Church, following the
custom of the epoch, because he wished to
devote his life to study. During some
years he led the life of a monk, and was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>92</span>
close student of Latin and Greek literature;
to the latter especially he owes his concise,
nervous, but virile style, resembling that
of Aristophanes. But soon fatigued with
religious hypocrisy, whose victim he refused
to become, he left the Cordelier and
Benedictine Orders and sought refuge in
the charming village of Leguge, that his
intimate friend, the Bishop of Maillezais,
had placed at his disposal.</p>

<p>Here, Rabelais gave himself up with
ardor to the study of belle lettres and
science, only meeting socially the freethinkers,
with whom he discussed those
great philosophic questions that had just
commenced to occupy the minds of the
really thoughtful. Such superior men as
Estissic, Bonaventure Desperriers, Clement
Marot, Jean Bouchet, Guillaume,
Bude, and Louis Berquin were the friends
of Rabelais.</p>

<p>Etienne Dolet, the poet, philosopher
and celebrated printer, who laid down his
life in opposition to monarchial and
religious tyranny, was the very particular
friend and adviser of Francois Rabelais,
and one day traced for him the programme
of a book destined, to his mind, to unveil
the vices and console the mass of victims
who suffered from social iniquities.</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Rabelais, in answer,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
“a book truly humane must be
addressed to all. The time has arrived
when philosophy must leave the clouds and
shine like the sun for the entire universe.
We must, from this hour, suck from the breast
of truth for the ignorant and learned. I
will see what is in me, and write a book of
philosophy, which shall instruct, console
and amuse the brave vintners of Deviniere
and the jolly wine-drinkers of Chinon, as
well as the learned. So well shall this be
done that Princes, Kings, Emperors and
paupers may drink gayly at one table
together. The <i>truth</i>, no matter how hard
to reach, and rugged though its nature,
must be related as truly as that found in
God’s book; and it shall be presented in a
living form, so human and natural that it
will be accepted by all the world, and
awaken in the soul of mankind a common
thought. What use is there, unless supported
on eternal conscience, to recount to
good and true men the histories that they
love to have related, histories they
themselves have made? For instance, the
‘History of Giants,’ so much printed in
our age, since the divine art of bookmaking
seems so well adapted to an end.
Through all of France I hear told the
dreadful prowess of the enormous giant
Gargantua; it is necessary to lay violent
hands on this history, include in it all the
world, and hand it back thus <i>newly created</i>
to the good people who invented the tale.
Here is the true secret; we derive from the
humble class of citizens their plain and
simple ideas, and give them back ornamented
with all the good things that the
study of philosophy brings us. The rustic
thoughts of the villager, such is the point I
wish to attain, in divulging treasures hidden
in secret up to the present time by the
enemies of light.” Such was the plot conceived
by the immortal Rabelais, which
soon served as a basis for “Gargantua and
Pantagruel.” Thus, under the familiar
form of an impossible and exaggerated fictitious
history, following the advice of
Dolet, our author proposed to attack in
his book all the hypocritical prejudices,
superannuated ideas, together with the political
and religious superstitions of the Middle
Ages;<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> he thus paved a way for a
Revolution, that must some day be accomplished
in social morals, to the profit of
science and reason. In order to change
the control of orthodox and monarchial
guardians, it was necessary to resort to
stratagems, to dissimulate in his plans of
attack and use the ideas and language of
the superior classes. He had often heard
the aristocracy use vulgar and obscene expressions,
and he was to put these back in
the mouths of his characters, so as to depict
their unrestrained passions, intrigues,
<i>amours</i>, the luxury of their dress, their
penchant for disputation, their tendency to
sensuality; all these were to be part of his
projected romance, which was not to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>93</span>
understood as irony even in the sense of
its paraboles.</p>

<p>The official sanction to publication was
to be obtained by making the authorities
believe that the author was only a gay and
witty philosopher, a prince of good fellows
whose doctrines were not dangerous to the
continuance of the nobility and the prerogatives
of the aristocracy; whose ideas presented
nothing subversive, neither as to
the secular power nor to sacerdotal domination.
Meantime, the Sorbonnists, whom
Rabelais had the impudence to rail at,
doubted perhaps the position reserved for
them in such a satire, as for several years previous
they had been secretly hostile to him,
which was a serious matter, considering
their influence.</p>

<p>The condemnation to the stake of Louis
Berquin, as a propagator of reform ideas;
the pursuit of Desperriers, accused of Atheism;
and the red danger-signals waving on
every hand, determined Rabelais, before
publishing his work, to quit Touraine and
to go to Montpellier, where he demanded
protection of the Faculty. His natural
pronounced taste for the natural sciences,
the avidity with which he continually extended
the circle of his knowledge, and,
above all, the liberty of University life,
had long before attracted the former monk
towards the study of medicine.</p>

<p>It was under these conditions that Rabelais
left Longey to go to Montpellier,
where his reputation for erudition, keen
wit and most perfect good nature had long
before preceded him.</p>

<p>The reading of all the classical Greek
authors, and principally Aristotle, had
initiated him in the natural sciences to
that extent that he was ready to receive his
degree of “Bachelor in Medicine” shortly
after his arrival at the University, under
the following circumstances: He had followed
the crowd of students who read
theses in the public halls, and thus mingled
with the auditors at the meeting; the discussion
was on the subject of botany. The
arguments of the orators appeared so weak
to Rabelais that he soon manifested signs
of impatience by a very sarcastic remark
that drew the attention of the Dean to the
newcomer. He was invited to enter the
enclosure reserved for doctors who debated,
but excused himself on the grounds
that his opinions would not be proper to
enunciate before such a gathering of
<i>savants</i>, and that he was, besides, only a
Bachelor; but, being pressed by the
crowd, who seemed pleased by his appearance
and manner, he treated the question
under discussion in such a masterly manner,
and with an eloquence so unequalled,
that rounds of applause greeted him on
every side; his knowledge of the subject
seemed unbounded. The Faculty was so
pleased that he was immediately honored
with the Baccalaureat. This was in November,
1530.</p>

<p>Rabelais had not taken his doctor’s
bonnet when his great medical talent was
fully known and appreciated by the professors
of the Medical Department of Montpellier,
where his winning grace, good
humor, and communicative gayety made
him friends everywhere.</p>

<p>Two of his boon companions at the
University were Antoine Saporta, who
afterwards became Dean of the Faculty,
and Guillaume Rondelet; with these men
he inaugurated at Montpellier theatrical
representations with a medical leaning.
He wrote some celebrated farces, among
others “The Dumb Wife” (<i>La Femme
Mute</i>), in which he himself assumed a leading
<i>role</i>—a farce which is related, as to
plot, in “Pantagruel,” by Panurge, under
the title of “History of a Good Husband
who Espoused a Dumb Wife.” The following
is an extract: “Now, the good
husband wished that his wife might speak,
and, thanks to the skill of a doctor and
surgeon, who cut a piece from under the
tongue, the woman commenced to talk,
and she talked and talked with recovered
speech, as though to make up for lost
time, until the husband returned to the
doctor for a remedy to keep his wife’s
mouth shut. The physician responded that
he had proper remedies for making women
speak, but no remedy had ever been discovered
to keep a wife’s tongue quiet. The
only thing he could suggest to the husband
was for the latter to become deaf in order
not to hear the woman’s voice. The old
reprobate submitted to an operation in
order to be deaf, and, when the physician
demanded his fee for professional services,
the husband answered that he was too deaf
to hear anything.” Then the doctor, in
order to make the man pay his bill, strove
to restore his hearing by forcing drugs
down the husband’s throat, whereupon
both husband and wife fell on the physician
and surgeon and so beat both medical men
with clubs that they were left for dead.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>94</span>
This farce was played at Montpellier by a
company of medical students, and enjoyed
an immense run of success. It was this
farce that helped Moliere out in one of his
scenes in his famous play “Medecin malgre
lui.”</p>

<p>His literary productions, strange to
say, did not injure his scientific work
meantime. During the time he resided at
Montpellier he published a translation of
some of the works of Hippocrates and
Galen, and also commenced his “Pantagruel,”
in which medical history may find
some valuable documents, for he showed
himself to be in every line not only a physician
but a philosopher.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> We will not
return to this, as it is too long, and would
take an infinity of time to recall his anatomical
erudition, and it is needless to say
he dissected as well as he wrote. A very
just conception of his style is obtained
from the description of the combat between
Brother John and the soldiers of Pichrocole,
who had invaded the Abbey of
Seville, a description which is terminated
in these droll lines: “Some died without
speaking, others spoke without dying; some
died in speaking, others spoke in dying.”</p>

<p>In all his chapters it is easy to perceive
that Rabelais never once forgot he was a
physician, and consequently a philanthropist,
for could the author of “Pantagruel”
be otherwise? He pleased all those who
suffered, especially gouty patients, to
whom he dedicated a portion of his work.
He states, at the beginning of his prologue,
to Gargantua, “This is for those who love
gayety, for laughter is a proper attribute of
man.”</p>

<p>It was this same sentiment of humanity
which led Rabelais to give disinterested
services to syphilitics, that unfortunate
class of sick whom the majority of doctors
disdained to treat in the sixteenth century.
In 1538 he went to Paris and made great
efforts to reform the treatment to which
such patients were barbarously subjected;
the number of such sufferers was great.
He works this fact into the description
that Epistemon gives of Hell, “where, not
counting Pope Sextus, there are five millions
of poxed devils, for there is as much
pox in one world as in the other.” But
Rabelais, alas for modern theories, did not
fish in the ether with hook and line for
microbes, while holding the white hands of
Venus.</p>

<p>It was Rabelais, then, who pleaded the
cause of these poor poxed patients, attacked
by mercury as well as the syphilis,
and who exclaims: “How often I have
seen them when they were anointed and
greased with mercurial ointment; their
faces as sharp as a butcher knife and their
teeth rattling like the key-board of a
broken-down organ or the creaking motion
of an old spinnet.”</p>

<p>It is evident he employed sweating
baths, however, since it is evidently proved
by that passage from the redoubtable
“Pantagruel’s” nativity: “For all sweat is
salt, as is evidenced if you but taste your
own sweat, or, a better experiment still,
try that of pox patients when they are
being sweated.”</p>

<p>We know, besides, that G. Torella,
affirms that “the best methods of curing
pox is to make the patient sweat near a
stove or hot oven for fifteen consecutive
days, while fasting meantime.”</p>

<p>Syphilis, as already remarked, was exceedingly
common in the sixteenth century,
as will be found by referring to the
writings of Italian and French specialists of
that epoch. Rabelais corroborates this
fact, for he frequently alludes to this
malady in his works; according to our
illustrious author great personages were not
exempt from the disease, not even the
Pope and the Sacred College of Rome, not
even kings and princes, in fact all the nobility,
for we read in chapter seventeen of
“Pantagruel”: “Moreover, Pope Sextus
gave me fifteen hundred pounds of rents
on his domains for having cured His Holiness
of <i>la bosse chancreuse</i>, which so much
tormented him that he feared to be crippled
all his life.” Now, a protuberant
chancre was nothing but an inguinal bubo,
whose suppuration was considered as a
favorable symptom of the disease.</p>

<p>Even the good “Pantagruel” did not
escape, more than others, the fashionable
contagion of his time, for we read: “Pantagruel
was taken sick, and his stomach
was so disordered that he could neither eat
nor drink; and as misfortunes never come
singly, he was seized with a clap, which
tormented him more than you would
think, but his physician succored him well,
and by means of drugs, lenitive and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>95</span>
diuretic, they caused him to urinate away his
misfortune (<i>pisser son malheur</i>). And his
urine was so hot that since that time it has
never grown cold, and there are different
places in France where he left his mark,
now called the <i>hot baths</i>, as, for instance,
at Cauterets, Limoux, Dax, Balaruc, Neris,
and Bourbon-Lancy.”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The chapters of Rabelais’ famous book
which most evidence his medical knowledge
are those discussing the perplexities of
Panurge on the question of marriage.
Pantagruel has long commented <i>pro</i> and
<i>con</i>, but has not fully made up his mind;
he does not demand a solution of the
matrimonial problem from Gods, dreams,
nor from the oracles of Sibyls. He, however,
consents to take council from Herr
Trippa, allegorical name bestowed by
Rabelais on the German Camilla Agrippa,
of Neterheim, a philosopher and physician
best known by his books on alchemy,
magic, and occult science. This <i>savant</i>
proposed to unveil our heroes’ future destiny
by “pyromancy, æromancy, hydromancy,
gyromancy”; or, better still, by
“necromancy I will make a spirit rise
from the dead, like Apollonius of Tyana to
Achilles, like the Witch of Endor to Saul,
who will tell you all, even as Erichto, dead
and rotten in body, rose in spirit and predicted
to Pompey the issue of the battle of
Pharsalia.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Panurge always refuses, but finishes by
taking advice from a priest, physician,
lawyer, and philosopher, who elucidate the
question. The consultation with the physician
Rondibilis, that is to say, the
author’s friend Guillaume Rondelet, fellow
student of Rabelais at the University of
Montpellier, is particularly interesting to
all doctors by reason of the anatomical and
physiological arguments.</p>

<p>The good physician Rondibilis thus responds
to Panurge on the question of
marriage:</p>

<p>“You say that you feel within yourself
the sharp pricking stings of sensuality. I
find in our Faculty of Medicine, and we
found our opinion on the ideas enunciated
by the ancient Platonists, that carnal
concupiscence is controlled in five manners.</p>

<p>“<i>Imprimis</i>, by wine; for intemperance
in wine makes the blood cold, slackens up
the cords, dissolves the nerves, dissipates
the generative seed, stupefies the senses,
perverts muscular movement; which weaknesses
are all impediments to the act of
generation. Hence it is that Bacchus,
God of tipplers, bousers, and drunkards, is
always painted beardless and dressed in a
woman’s habit, like unto a thing effeminate
or a eunuch. You know full well the
antique proverb, <i>i.e.</i>, that Venus is chilled
without the society of Ceres and Bacchus.”</p>

<p>These reflections on the general effects
of alcohol on the nervous system are very
just. As to its particular effects on the
function of generation, it is admitted by all
hygienists that alcohol taken occasionally
in excess excites venereal desires, but
when taken habitually it weakens the
generative functions. Amyot remarks that
“<i>those who drink much wine are slothful in
performing the generative act, and their seed
are good for nothing, as a rule</i>.”</p>

<p>Rondibilis told Panurge the truth. Let
us now see what other advice he gave his
patient, and also note the methods by
which he proposed to secure the best possible
completion of the conjugal act.</p>

<p>“<i>Secondly</i>, the fervency of lust is abated
by means of certain drugs and plants,
which make the taker cold-blooded towards
women; in other words, unfit him
for the act of copulation. Such are the
water lily, agnus castor, willow twigs,
hemp stalks, tamarisk, mandrake, gnat
flower, hemlock, and others; the which
entering the human body by their elementary
virtues and specific properties freeze
and destroy the prolific germinal fluid, and
obstruct the generative spirit instead of
leading it to those passages and conduits
designed for its reception by Nature, and,
by preventing expulsion, prevent man from
undertaking the feat of amorous dalliance.”</p>

<p>We will not enter into a discussion of
the anaphrodisiac value of the plants mentioned
by Rondibilis. We still recognize
the soothing properties of <i>Agnus Castus</i>
and <i>vitex</i>, or monk’s powder, as it is sometimes
called; also that of belladonna, hemlock,
digitalis, lupulin, camphor, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>96</span>
hempseed; as for tamarack and willow
bark, their virtues are at least doubtful.</p>

<p>But from this passage from Rabelais we
must conclude that the therapeutic uses of
plants was already well known in the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>Again says Doctor Rondibilis: “Passion
or lechery is subdued by hard labor
and continual toiling, which makes such a
dissolution in the whole body that the
blood has neither time nor leisure to spare
for seminal resudations or superfluity of
the third concoction. Nature particularly
reserves itself, deeming it much more necessary
to conserve the individual rather
than to multiply the human species. Thus
the chaste Diana hunted incessantly.
Thus the tired and overworked are said to
be ‘castrated.’ We continually see semi-impotency
among athletes. In this manner
wrote Hippocrates in his great work,
‘<i>Liber de Aere, Aqua, et Locis</i>’: ‘There is
in Scythia a tribe which has been more impotent
than eunuchs to venereal desires,
because these people live continually on
horseback and hard work. To the contrary,
idleness, the mother of luxury, begets
sexual passion.’”</p>

<p>There is no necessity for long commentaries
to demonstrate that manual labor
and active physical exercise lessen the
natural tendency to erotic ideas. The
workingman and peasant are, as all the
world knows, less given to the passion of
love than the idle and luxurious of the
cities. And the reasons given above by
the Middle Age physicians are to-day admitted
by all physiological writers.</p>

<p>But let us continue the advice of Rondibilis:</p>

<p>“Fervent study diminishes the erotic
tendency, for under such conditions there
is an incredible resolution of the spirits, so
that they never rest from carrying on a
generative resolution. When we contemplate
the form of a man attentive to his
studies we shall see all the arteries of the
brain tied down as though with a cord, in
order to furnish him spirits sufficient to
keep filled the ventricles of common sense,
imagination, apprehension, memory, co-ordination,”
etc.</p>

<p>These rather vague and imperfect
physiological explanations are open to
discussion, but we all are aware that
an excess of work, of intellectual labor
applied to science, letters, or arts, is
recognized to-day as a cause for
weakening of venereal desires and the forerunner
of impotency.</p>

<p>Again says Rondibilis: “As to the
venereal act, again: I am of the opinion
that the desire is subdued by the methods
resorted to by the Hermits of Thebaide,
who macerate their bodies so as to quell
sensuality; this they do twenty-five or
thirty times a day, to reduce the rebellion
of the flesh.”</p>

<p>This is to say that a certain cause of
impotence consists in an excess of genital
apparatus, no matter of what variety; and
we will add what the physician of Montpellier
has not mentioned, that this maceration,
which was nothing else than masturbation,
superinduced spermatorrhœa,
the morbid effects of which, on the human
economy, are well known.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to follow our Master
Rondibilis in all his dissertations regarding
the anatomical and moral imperfections of
women, which he attributes to the misleading
of Nature’s ordinary good sense, which
he thinks “molded women more for the
delectation of man and the perpetuity of
the species rather than to secure perfection
in the individual.” One thing is certain,
that is, that he speaks with much physiological
spirit, and that the amiable Panurge
is so enchanted with the learned talk of
Doctor Rondibilis that he does not forget
to pay him a consultation fee, for, says the
veracious chronicles, “Approaching him
he put in his hand, without saying a word,
four <i>nobles a la rose</i>, the which Rondibilis
accepted gracefully.” These coins were
made of fine gold, and struck off in 1334
by Edward III., of England. They had
on one side the figure of a ship, and on the
other a rose, arms of the Houses of York
and Lancaster. This consultation was
royally paid for in money of the Realm.</p>

<p>If we study Rabelais closely we find he
was a contagionist of pronounced type,
and believed in no other prophylactic
against pestilence except flight from the
contaminated country. This is what he
makes his character “Pantagruel” do when
the latter was in a village “which he found
most pleasant to dwell in, had not the
plague chased him out.” In another passage
our author remarks: “The cause of
plague is a stinking and infecting exhalation.”
It must be added, however, that
the plague was endemic at this epoch, and
people, on the word of prophets, attributed
the cause to divine wrath. The roads were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>97</span>
crowded with pilgrims going to make vows
and prayers at the chapel of Saint Sebastian.
How often had Rabelais endeavored
to combat these superstitions! As a proof
of this let us make another short quotation
from the great satirist: “False prophets
announce this lie! They thus blaspheme
the Just and the Saints of God, whom they
make out to be demons of cruelty. These
canting hypocrites, the clergy, preach in
my native Province that Saint Anthony
gives erysipelas, Saint Eutrope gives dropsy,
Saint Gildas makes people insane, and
Saint Gildus perpetuates the gout. I am
amazed that our glorious King allows these
impostors to preach such scandalous lies in
his realm; and they should be punished
rather than those who, by magic or
otherwise, may bring the plague into
the country. The <i>plague</i> only kills the
body; but clerical impostors poison human
souls.”</p>

<p>It required a grand amount of courage
to hold and express such opinions in the
sixteenth century, in the very face of the
butchers of the Inquisition. This courage
was not acquired by Rabelais from his
philosophic studies nor his religious ideas;
it was inspired by scientific convictions, of
which the Holy Office dared not demand a
retraction, as it did in the case of Galileo.
<i>For the Papacy, from the earliest periods of
time, has always avoided controversy with
medical science.</i> And we may recall here
the device that Rabelais inscribed in his
heart, as on the first page of his books: “<i>To
Doctor Francois Rabelais and to his friends</i>.”
He was proud of his medical title, and he
considered practice (and we mention this
fact inasmuch as an ancient writer has
claimed he did not belong to our glorious
profession) as a sort of magistral and sacerdotal
duty, and demanded, as the first
condition for making a doctor, that the
candidate for the honored medical degree
should have <i>a healthy heart</i>.</p>

<p>It was for his patients’ edification that
he composed portions of his books. He
wished to calm their senses by revealing to
them the great spectacle of the world; and
its purpose is all apparent, <i>i.e.</i>, to inspire
among mankind a love for humanity;
having no other personal ambition himself
than to play the part of doctor in the <i>role</i>
of life, to dress the wounds of the unfortunate,
to treat diseases of the body and
minister to the low-spirited and downhearted.</p>

<p>The strong masculine independence of
his character is noted in the manner in
which he has attacked all oppressions, be
they from science or the Princes of the
Church. He refused to blindly submit to
the authority of the so-called masters in
physics, and reserved the right to freely
discuss their doctrines. “Hippocrates,
Galen and Aristotle,” he remarks, “great
as they are, never knew all. Science is the
work of many successions of generations,
and that which makes its grandeur so
mysterious is that the more we know the
more new problems are presented us for
solution. Science, like, Nature, is infinite.”
This lofty language deeply astounded
thinkers, and roused against its
author that same servile Pontifical party
that prowled and plotted in the gilded
antechamber of the aristocratic chateaux-owners
of the day; the same variety of
creatures we see to-day circulating, Indian
file, through the corridors of our academies,
faculties and courts. For the new
as for the ancient, it is always the same
word of the past, <i>Magister dixit</i>. That
never changes.</p>

<p>While acting as professor at Lyons,
Rabelais gave “a course of anatomical
lectures, given with so much eloquence,”
writes Eugene Noel, “as to astonish all
listeners; and he showed his audience
how man was constructed, like a magnificent
and precious piece of architecture, a
thing of grace and beauty, so that the
people crowded to the lecture-room to hear
him. Dolet followed these lectures. One
day Rabelais lectured on the cadaver of a
man who had been hanged, and he discoursed
on his subject with so much grace
and warmth, showing so clearly the miracle
of our nature, that Dolet, leaving the
hall, exclaimed: “Would I were hanged
and I should be so could I be the occasion
of so divine a discourse!” Some passages
of this celebrated lecture may be found
embodied in “Pantagruel;” for we see
that he taught, outside the grandeur of
creation, respect for life and <i>what a sacred
thing blood is</i>.</p>

<p>Says Rabelais: “A single labor pain of
this world is to manufacture blood continually.
In this work each member has its
proper office. Nutrition is furnished by
the whole of nature; it is the bread, it is
wine—these are the aliments of all species.
In order to find and prepare this material,
the hands of mankind work, the feet climb<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>98</span>
and bear the machinery, the eyes lead us,
the tongue tastes for us, the teeth masticate
our food, while the stomach receives
and digests.” Here our anatomist dwells
somewhat at length on the formation of the
blood and the part played in digestion by
our organs, adding:</p>

<p>“What joy among these dispensing
officers of the body when, after their complex
work and hard labor, they see this
stream of red gold. Each limb separates
and opens to assimilate or purify anew this
treasure, <i>the blood</i>. The heart, with its
musical diastole and systole, subtilizes it so
that, met at the ventricle, it is perfection;
then, by the veins, it returns from all the
limbs. The harmony of Heaven is no
greater than that of the body of man. One
is overwhelmed and lost when endeavoring
to penetrate the depths of this wonderful
microcosm. Believe me, there is therein
something divine; ah! this <i>little world</i> is
so good that, this alimentation achieved, <i>it
thinks already for those who are not yet born</i>.”</p>

<p>This extract from Rabelais serves to repel
the accusation of scepticism so often
made against him, and we see two men in
the personality of the celebrated writer of
the sixteenth century: the <i>savant</i> who enriched
<i>belle lettres</i>, and the popular philosopher
who addressed himself to the disinherited
of fortune and science. It was for the
latter that he claimed from secular power
the right to the material satisfactions of life,
aside from the opinion of Pope and Church.
Rabelais was the very incarnation of philanthrophy
and in this above all other things
he has honored the medical profession, of
which he is an immortal member.</p>

<p>Rabelais it was who wished to be Architriclinus
for the poor, for the indigent, the
joyous heart of the Pantagruelist. It was
to the latter that he remarked: “Drink
merry friends, eternally, drink like hungry
fishes. I shall, be your cup-bearer and
host; I shall attend to your thirst, and
never fear that the wine will fall short as at
the wedding in Cana. As much as you
draw from the tap, as much more will I
astonish you at the bung; so that the wine
cask shall never be empty; source of all
life’s enjoyment, perpetual spring of happiness.”</p>

<p>The recollection of his youth, so calm
and joyous in his father’s saloon, “the
Lamprey Tavern,” amid the brave drinkers
and gay wits, with full goblets of the
rich Septembral vintage, pure, sparkling,
rosy, grape juice, the glorious wine of his
native Province, had much influence on
the ideas and opinions of the philosopher.
He heard again, as in the echos of memory,
the merry songs of the grape gatherers,
and the Bacchic chants died away in
musical notes adown the aisles of the Temple
of Time. He was happy in knowing
himself to be Francois Rabelais, doctor in
medicine, but looking backwards, he felt
the vague and indefinable sentiment of
poetry, that is ever associated with great
genius. It was then he cried:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O bouteille!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pleine tout</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Des mysteres,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">D’un oreille</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Je t’ecoute.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet his heart was never sad, nor even
tinged with melancholy. He dreamed of
the golden age of a universal fraternity
among mankind and eternal joy, the duration
of the soul’s exile on earth.</p>

<p>To the Burgundy wine of France we
owe this moral analgesia, which chases
away passions and all cares engendered by
stupid worldly ambition. He preferred the
face of a jolly drunkard to the head of a
tyrannical Cæsar. He loved the wine bibber’s
nose, as he says “that musical bugle
richly inlaid with colors of gorgeous design,
purple, with crimson bands, enameled
with jewel-like pimples, embroidered with
veins of heavenly blue. Such a nose has
the good priest Panzoult, and Piedbois,
physician at Angers.”</p>

<p>Rabelais did not ignore the fact that
these “good drinkers” once had the gout,
for he did not forget to give a medical
prognosis in the case of the voracious Gargantura.
“All his life he will be subject
to gravel.” But what difference is it
though he had gravel, and the red nose,
that glorious work of Bacchus? He derived
his warmest consolation from the thought
that a little good wine heated his blood
and soothed the bitterness of life,
making him forget the injustice of some,
and the ingratitude of others; a veritable
<i>nepenthe</i> for his miseries, cares and apprehensions.
Every good drinker is a sage.
Horace had said so, and Rabelais who had
read this master of Latin poetry, inscribed
on the front of his dwelling place</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“HIC BIBITUR.”</p>

<p>“<i>Within this place they drink wine, that
delicious, precious, celestial, joyous, God-given,
nectar and liquor.</i>”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>99</span></p>

<p>But, at the bottom of Master Francois
Rabelais’ cask was a flavor not fancied by
all the world, the taste of free thought,
opposition to all tyranny, a Homeric spirit
with a sonorous voice whose echo will
resound into future ages. Our authors,
including historians, philosophers and
poets, revere his memory; and one of their
greatest minds has said: “Rabelais was a
Gaul, and what is Gallic is Grecian, for
Rabelais is the formidable masque of
antique comedy detached from the Greek
proscenium, bronze turned into living flesh,
a human face full of laughter, making us
merry and laughing with us.” A similar
judgment is pronounced by the author of
<i>Burgraves</i>, and <i>Notre Dame de Paris</i>.
Rabelais is immortal in spite of the ecclesiastical
detractors who have covertly assailed
his memory for several centuries.</p>

<p>A doctor, philosopher, writer, he was
the first exception in the positive world, of
that profound faith identical with science.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>100</span>
It was for that reason that the physicians
of the Middle Ages looked up to him as
one of their glories; it is for this reason
that his works should hereafter be placed
among the medical classics and no longer
remain neglected by the masses of that
profession he honored. In the epitaph he
left, he did not forget the doctoral title he
always so honorably bore:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cordiger et medicus, dein pastor et intus obivi,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Si nomen quæris, te mea Scripta docent.”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He did not think in making this verse,
that the Parisians would one day engrave
his name with his last words on the marble
of his statue as witness for future generations
that the memory of Rabelais must
never be effaced.</p>

the human cadaver not only as an impious act,

death, did not suddenly abandon the body, but
withdrew itself gradually, until it left the
limbs and finally entered the thoracic cavity.
Thus the body could not be dissected without suffering.

<p>“About the year of Our Savior 1174, before
the Feast of St. Andre, one Jehan Dugue of the

for the first time, but it was only in the year 900
that the two Arabian physicians, Rhazes and
Avicenna, wrote their works on this malady and
determined the clinical forms, giving the prognosis
and diagnostic signs and the methods of treatment.
Rhazes, physician to the hospital at Bagdad,
recommended, on account of the warm
climate of his country, cool and refreshing drinks.
In the period of lever, he advised copious bleedings,
and for children wet cupping. He covered
up his patients in warm clothing, had their bodies
well rubbed, and gave them a plentiful supply of
ice-water to drink. In certain cases, he placed
large vessels of hot water, one in front and one
behind the patient, in order to facilitate the
eruptive process; then the body was anointed
before the sweat cooled off. He prescribed
lotions for the eyes when the eruption was heavy
in the ocular regions. He advised the use of
gargles. He opened the pustules, when they
maturated, with a golden needle, and absorbed
the pus with pledgets of cotton. He gave opium
for the diarrhœa and insomnia, and, when the
disease declined, used mild purgatives, etc., etc.</p>

<div class="footnote">

works. Rhazes mentions measles in his works,
giving a clear account of its diagnosis and treatment.
He says that when the patient experiences
great anxiety and falls into a syncope, he should
be plunged into a cold bath and then be vigorously
rubbed over the skin to the end of provoking
the eruption. Avicenna did not recognize
measles, considering it only a billious fever or
small pox. Constantine, the African, follows the
example of Avicenna and reproduces the opinion
of the Arabian School without comments.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="label">[40]</a> “The reign of astrology,” remarks Sprengle,
“led physicians to attribute the affection to the
influence of the stars. Saturn who devoured his
children, had, following the common expression,
produced the pox. It was his conjunction with
Mars, in the sign of the Virgin, that gave rise to
the epidemic. Or it was the conjunction of Jupiter
with Saturn in Scorpio, as in 1484. At other
times it was the opposition of these two planets,
as was noticed in 1494. Finally, it was the conjunction
of Saturn and Mars, as in 1496. (“If it
was the combined action of Saturn, Jupiter and
Mars in the sign of the Virgin that produced the
syphilis, the astrologers might well think that
Mercury could destroy the effects of the disease,
which would be better than bleeding or purging.”)
Leonicus attributed the cause of the
venereal plague to the general inundations that
occurred about that period, <i>i.e.</i>, 1493, and afterwards
in 1528. Besides, they recognized as a
cause of these venereal symptoms a general acridity
of the humors and the pre eminence of the
four cardinal humors, but more especially of a
metastasis of bilious matter from the liver towards
the genital organs.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">[50]</a> Magic had rank among the sciences of the
school of Alexandria 150 years before our era, in
a medico-theosophical sect, whose members applied
to cosmogony the doctrine of emanation.
These admitted that demons come from the
source of eternal light, and that man might become
their equal by leading a contemplative life.
There were a number of such demons, all phenomena
of nature, and particularly all diseases
were attributed to demonic power. These demons
were incorporeal, and their light surrounded
certain bodies in the same manner that the sun
gleams in water without being contained therein.
(See Sprengel). Let it not be forgotten that the
Alexandrian Library, the richest institution of the
kind in ancient times, and the Temple of Serapis,
in which it was installed, were committed to the
flames at the instigation of the monks, by order
of their creature, the apathetic Emperor Theodosius.</p>

they say are the Souls of our ancestors, serving
us now as <i>mediums</i>; we loan them our natural

“These sounds are due to a slight previous displacement
of the patella, of the tibia on the
femur, when the tendon of the long lateral peroneal
suddenly brings the parts back to their first
position. This displacement is induced by muscular
contraction and can be easily cultivated by
habit.” The author of this definition supports
his statement by the <i>pretended experiments</i> of Flint

as being haunted by a phantom. The philosopher,

first night he occupied the same, while engaged in
his studies, he heard and saw a spirit, that made
repeated signs to him to follow; he accordingly
followed this shade of the departed into the courtyard,
where the ghost disappeared. Athenodorus
marked the spot of ground on which the spirit
had last stood, and next day asked the town magistrate
to dig up the earth at the place named;
there they found bones loaded with chains, which
were released and given decent sepulture, with
all due funeral honors. The phantom returned
no more (Pliny the Younger, Letters VII et

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 1. General Terms">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 3. The Project Gutenberg Literary">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
